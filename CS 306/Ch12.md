---

## 💻 **Turing Machine: Definition and Concepts**

---

### 📘 **What Is a Turing Machine?**

* A **mathematical model of computation** created by **Alan Turing** in the 1930s.
* Describes an **abstract machine** that manipulates symbols on a **tape** according to a **set of rules**.
* Aimed to solve problems like the **Entscheidungsproblem** (decision problem).
* Serves as the **foundation for modern computers**.

---

### 🧩 **Key Components**

| Component                | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tape**                 | Infinite strip with cells that hold symbols (e.g., 0, 1, blank).             |
| **Control Head (CPU)**   | Reads and writes symbols and moves left/right. Stores the **current state**. |
| **Read/Write Mechanism** | Interacts with the tape based on instructions.                               |
| **States**               | Finite set including start and **halting** (end) state.                      |

---

### ⚙️ **How It Works**

* **Input** = Initial configuration: tape content, head position, state.

* **Instructions** = Written as `T: (s, a) → (s', a', d)`

  * `s` = current state
  * `a` = current symbol under the head
  * `s'` = next state
  * `a'` = symbol to write
  * `d` = direction (Left or Right)

* **Output** = Final tape content **if** the machine **halts**.

* **Halting Problem**: It’s impossible to predict if the machine will halt for every possible input (undecidable problem).

---

### ➕ **Example: Unary Addition**

* Uses **unary numbers**:
  5 → `00000`, 3 → `000`, separated by a `c`:
  `00000c000` → `00000000` (result = 8)

#### Step-by-step Tape State (simplified):

1. Start at first 0
2. Move right until `c`
3. Replace `c` with `0`
4. Move right until blank (`X`)
5. Replace blank with `X`
6. Final tape: `00000000` (8 in unary)

---

### 📈 **Time Complexity**

* Based on number of tape moves:

  * `T(n) = O(n log n)`

Here’s a structured and engaging summary of your lesson on **qubits, superposition, and entanglement** in quantum computing:

---

## 🧠 **Quantum Computing: Qubits, Superposition & Entanglement**

---

### ⚛️ **What Is a Qubit?**

* A **qubit** (quantum bit) is the fundamental unit of quantum computing.
* Unlike a classical bit (0 or 1), a **qubit can be 0, 1, or both at once**.
* This ability to exist in **multiple states simultaneously** is called **superposition**.

---

### 🌊 **Superposition Explained**

* In quantum physics, particles like qubits do **not** have definite states until observed.
* A qubit exists in a blend (superposition) of 0 and 1.
* **Measurement collapses** the superposition into a definite value (either 0 or 1).
* This behavior is **probabilistic**, not deterministic — outcomes are governed by probability amplitudes (complex math).

> *Think of a spinning coin: it’s both heads and tails — until you catch it.*

---

### 🔗 **Entanglement: Quantum Connections**

* **Entanglement** is a quantum phenomenon where two qubits become linked.

* Measuring one **instantly reveals** the state of the other — even if they’re **light-years apart**.

* In a **2-qubit system**, four possible states exist due to superposition:
  `|00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩`

* **CNOT Gate**: A quantum logic gate that helps **create entanglement** between qubits.

---

### 📦 **Quantum Register**

* A **quantum register** is a collection of indexed qubits (e.g., qubit 0, qubit 1…).
* An *n-qubit register* can hold **2ⁿ possible states** in superposition.

  * Example: 3 qubits → 8 states; 37 qubits → over **137 billion** states.
* Instead of fixed values, each qubit’s state is described by a **probability amplitude** — meaning it might be in a state with a certain chance, not certainty.

---

### 🧮 **Memory Comparison**

| Qubits | Classical Memory Needed |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| 3      | \~128 KB                |
| 37     | >2 TB                   |

Quantum states grow **exponentially**, requiring massive memory to represent them on classical systems.

---

### 📌 **Lesson Summary**

* **Qubits** can be 0, 1, or both (superposition).
* **Entanglement** allows qubits to be linked in a way that defies distance.
* **Quantum registers** track qubit states, which are probabilistic, not fixed.
* **Quantum gates** like **CNOT** are used to manipulate qubit states and create entanglement.
* Quantum computing operates on **probability**, not certainty — a core feature that sets it apart from classical computing.
