### Electric Gate Symbols for Boolean Functions

#### Introduction to Logic Gates

The shift from analog to digital computing was enabled by the implementation of Boolean logic using **electronic components** called **logic gates**. Each gate produces a predictable output based on its inputs, according to the **truth table** of the Boolean function it represents—such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, and NOR.

#### Function of Logic Gates

Despite internal technological differences over time, all logic gates adhere to the **same input-output behavior**, allowing them to be symbolized in circuit schematics much like analog components (e.g., resistors and capacitors). These representations help in visualizing and analyzing digital circuits.

#### Anatomy of a Logic Gate Symbol

A typical logic gate symbol includes:

* **Two input lines** (except the NOT gate, which has one)
* A **gate-specific shape or label**
* **One output line**

Each symbol aligns with a truth table, making its function easy to interpret.
*Figure 1* illustrates a generic gate symbol with its corresponding truth table.

#### Industry Standards for Logic Gate Symbols

Two main international standards define logic gate symbols:

* **ANSI/IEEE Std 91-1984 & 91a-1991**: Commonly used in the U.S.
* **IEC 60617-12**: Widely adopted in Europe

These standards help ensure consistency in technical diagrams and communication across industries.

#### The Distinctive Shape Set

This approach uses **unique geometric shapes** for each logic gate:

* Easily recognizable
* Rooted in historical design
* Common in educational materials and simplified schematics

Examples include:

* Curved back for OR
* Flat-edged D shape for AND
* Triangle with a circle for NOT

#### The Rectangular Shape Set

This system uses **rectangles** with **textual labels** inside to indicate the gate’s function (e.g., “AND,” “OR,” “INV” for inverter). Its benefits include:

* Simplified design
* Easy extension for new or custom logic operations
* Preferred in complex or scalable diagrams

The **IEC standard** allows flexibility between shapes, so long as labels are used consistently.

#### Inversion Symbols

* **Distinctive shape set**: A small circle at the output indicates inversion.
* **Rectangular shape set**: A **diagonal line** represents inversion.

*Figure 2* shows the AND, OR, and NOT gates in both shape sets with their respective truth tables.

#### Conclusion

Logic gates are the building blocks of digital systems, each governed by Boolean logic. Their ideal behaviors are represented with standardized symbols that vary by region and application. Whether through **distinctive shapes** or **rectangular text labels**, these symbols make it possible to visually model and design reliable digital circuits using Boolean functions.

**Which of the following is an example of a logic gate symbol from the distinctive shape set?**
EMPTY

**What is a chief advantage of the standard rectangular shape set of Boolean logic symbols?**
The standard rectangular shape set of Boolean logic symbols does not require the introduction of new symbols when new logic operations are introduced.


**Which of the following is not true about logic gates?**
Logic gate symbols vary based on the type of components used to implement them.

**What is the chief advantage of the standard distinctive shape set of Boolean logic symbols?**
Boolean logic symbols in the standard distinctive shape set are easily recognizable.

**Which industry standard describes both a distinctive shape set and a rectangular shape set of logic gates?**
Both ANSI/IEEE Std 91-1984 / ANSI/IEEE Std 91a-1991 and IEC 60617-12
