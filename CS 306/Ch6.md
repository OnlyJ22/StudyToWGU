### Latches and SR-Latch

#### Core Concepts

* **Latch**: A basic sequential circuit that stores 1 bit of data.
* Implements two key features:

  * **Memory**: Maintains its state.
  * **Time**: State changes based on a control signal.

---

#### SR (Set-Reset) Latch

| S | R | Q (Next State)          |
| - | - | ----------------------- |
| 0 | 0 | Holds previous state    |
| 0 | 1 | 0 (Reset)               |
| 1 | 0 | 1 (Set)                 |
| 1 | 1 | Undefined (Not allowed) |

* Q' is the complement of Q.
* Problem: The condition S = 1 and R = 1 is invalid.

---

#### Gated SR Latch (with Enable G)

| G (Enable) | S | R | Q (Next State)       |
| ---------- | - | - | -------------------- |
| 0          | X | X | Holds previous state |
| 1          | 0 | 0 | Holds previous state |
| 1          | 0 | 1 | 0                    |
| 1          | 1 | 0 | 1                    |
| 1          | 1 | 1 | Not allowed          |

* G (or E) acts as an enable signal to control updates to the latch.
* Isolates the circuit when G = 0.

---

#### D-Latch

* Built from an SR latch with an inverter between S and R.
* D (Data) is the only input.
* When G = 1, output Q = D.
* Avoids the invalid S = 1 and R = 1 condition.
* Commonly used for data storage and synchronization.

---

#### JK-Latch

| G | J | K | Q (Next State) |
| - | - | - | -------------- |
| 0 | X | X | Holds previous |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | Holds previous |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0              |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1              |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | Toggle (Q')    |

* Generalized form of the SR latch.
* Allows toggling the output when J = K = 1.

---

#### T-Latch

* Special case of the JK latch where J = K = T.
* T = 1: Toggles output.
* T = 0: Holds output.
* Commonly used for frequency division in counters.

---

#### Oscillation Problem

* When the enable signal (G) is active too long in a toggling latch (like T or JK), it can cause continuous switching between 0 and 1.
* This leads to unstable and undefined output.

---

#### Solutions to Oscillation

1. **Master-Slave Latch**

   * Two latches used together: master and slave.
   * Master is enabled when G = 1; slave is enabled when G = 0.
   * Output of master becomes input to slave, preventing oscillation.

2. **Edge-Triggered Flip-Flop**

   * Only updates state on the edge (rising or falling) of the clock signal.
   * Provides precise timing control.
   * Example: JK Flip-Flop triggered on rising edge.

---

#### Summary

* Latches store a bit of data and are fundamental to sequential circuit design.
* SR-latch provides basic memory but has invalid states.
* D-latch eliminates invalid states by using a single input.
* JK-latch supports toggling behavior.
* T-latch simplifies toggling for frequency control.
* Oscillation is addressed using master-slave or edge-triggered designs for reliable operation.

----------------------------------
The JK-latch
- allows us to inverse the state when its input is JK = '11'

We can implement both the memory and the time concepts using a
- gated SR-latch

The D-latch is built by
- placing an inverter between the S and R inputs of an SR-latch

The T-latch architecture is used to
- divide frequency

A flip-flop is a latch enabled by
- one or both edges of the square signal

### Summary: Counters in Digital Design

**Definition:**
A **digital binary counter** is a type of sequential circuit that transitions through a fixed sequence of states, regardless of the arithmetic order of those states.

---

#### Types of Counters

#### 1. **Synchronous Counters**

* All flip-flops (FFs) are triggered by the **same clock signal**.
* **Example design:**
  A counter that follows the sequence: 0, 1, 3, 2, 7, 4

  * Requires **3 FFs** (A = LSB)
  * Construct state table to determine input conditions for each FF.
  * Simplify using JK state transition table:

    * `JA = C'`
    * `KA = AB`
    * `JB = A`
    * `KB = C`
    * `JC = BA'`
    * `KC = B'`
* **Advantages:** Easier to design and understand; predictable timing.

---

#### 2. **Asynchronous Counters**

* FFs are **not clocked by the same signal**.
* Only the **LSB FF** is clocked directly by the input signal.
* Other FFs are clocked by the **output of preceding FFs**, reducing power usage.
* **Example design:** Counts 0 to 6

  * Determine FFs' clock sources by checking matching edge transitions.
  * Use outputs or their complements to provide appropriate triggering.
  * Simplify the JK inputs:

    * `JA = C' + B'`
    * `JB = A`
    * `KB = C + A`
    * `KA = JC = KC = 1`
* **Advantages:** Reduces power consumption during idle states.
* **Disadvantages:** More complex to design and may suffer from timing issues due to signal propagation delays.

---

#### Comparison

| Feature           | Synchronous Counter             | Asynchronous Counter               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Clocking          | All FFs share the same clock    | FFs are clocked sequentially       |
| Design Complexity | Simpler                         | More complex                       |
| Power Consumption | Higher (all FFs clocked always) | Lower (FFs only clocked as needed) |
| Speed             | Faster and more reliable        | Slower due to propagation delays   |

---

#### Summary

* Counters are used in digital systems to transition between defined states.
* Synchronous counters are ideal for performance and timing reliability.
* Asynchronous counters are suitable for power-saving applications.
* Design involves:

  1. Determining the number of FFs.
  2. Creating a state table.
  3. Using JK flip-flop rules to derive inputs.
  4. Simplifying expressions and wiring the circuit accordingly.

### Registers and Shift Registers

### Sequential Circuits and Finite State Machines

#### Introduction

* **Sequential circuits** implement two key concepts:

  * **Memory**: Remain in a state for a period.
  * **Time**: Transition to another state after a specific event.
* Example: A counter that increments when someone enters a room.

#### Fixed vs. Controlled Transitions

* **Simple counters**: Have a fixed next state (e.g., always go from 4 to 5).
* **General sequential circuits**: Use **conditions** to determine the next state, enabling multiple possible transitions from a single state.

#### State Machines

* **Finite State Machine (FSM)**:

  * A system with a finite number of states.
  * At any time, the machine is in exactly one state.
  * Transitions between states depend on input conditions.
* Example: **Up/Down Counter**

  * Has a control input for direction.
  * From state 4:

    * If counting up → next state is 5.
    * If counting down → next state is 3.

#### State Diagrams

* **State Diagram**: A visual model of an FSM.

  * **States** = circles.
  * **Transitions** = arrows with conditions.
* **Uni-directional Counter**:

  * One transition per state.
  * Fixed state order (e.g., 0 → 1 → 2 → 3...).
* **Up/Down Counter**:

  * Two transitions per state (up/down).
  * Transition depends on control input.

#### Summary

* Sequential circuits differ from combinational ones by incorporating **memory and time**.
* General sequential circuits can choose transitions based on **input conditions**.
* These are modeled as **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**.
* FSMs are best represented using **state diagrams**, showing all possible state transitions.

### Sequence Detectors

#### What Is a Sequence Detector?

A **sequence detector** is a sequential circuit that outputs `1` when a specific bit pattern is detected at its data input. It consists of:

* A **data input**
* A **clock input**
* A **single output**

For example, a detector for the pattern `0111` outputs `1` only when the last four bits match that pattern.

> **Note:** These detectors do **not reset** after a pattern match. Previous bits are retained for overlapping detections.

#### Moore Machine Model

* The detector is built using a **Moore state machine**, where:

  * Outputs depend only on the **state**, not directly on inputs.
  * Transitions between states depend on the **input**.
* Each state includes:

  * **Name**
  * **Output value (0 or 1)**
  * **State code** (binary encoding)

#### Design of a 0111 Detector

* **Init** → Initial state (output = 0)
* States created based on progression through the pattern:

  1. `Init`
  2. `Received 0`
  3. `Received 01`
  4. `Received 011`
  5. `Received 0111` (output = 1)

Each input value (0 or 1) triggers state transitions:

* If the input doesn’t follow the expected sequence, reset to a relevant earlier state.
* If a `1` follows the detected `0111`, transition to the state for detecting a new `0111`.

#### State Table

The state table includes:

* Current state bits: `C B A`
* Input `d`
* Next state bits: `C+ B+ A+`
* Output `z`
* Flip-flop input functions: `JA`, `KA`, `JB`, `KB`, `JC`, `KC`

#### Derived Flip-Flop and Output Equations

Based on simplification from the state table:

* `JA = B + d'`
* `KA = d`
* `JB = A·d`
* `KB = A + d'`
* `JC = B·A·d`
* `KC = 1`
* `z = A·B·C'`

These equations determine how the flip-flops transition from one state to another and when the output `z` is `1`.

#### Final Circuit

Using the equations above, the **circuit** for the 0111 sequence detector is constructed with:

* Three JK flip-flops (for states A, B, C)
* Logic gates for the flip-flop inputs
* Output logic for `z`

You can simulate this circuit using software like **Logisim**.

#### Summary

* A **sequence detector** recognizes a specific binary pattern in an input stream.
* It is implemented using a **Moore machine**, which separates state logic from output.
* **State diagrams**, **state tables**, and **flip-flop equations** guide the design.
* The design is scalable and used in real-world applications like **digital locks**, **protocol handlers**, and **pattern recognizers**.

### Asynchronous Counters and Sequential Circuits

#### What Is a Counter?

A **counter** is a sequential circuit that progresses through a predefined sequence of states in response to **input pulses**, also known as **count pulses**. These pulses may come from:

* A **clock**
* An **external event**

Counters can follow **binary sequences** or custom sequences.

#### Types of Counters

* **Synchronous Counters**: All flip-flops are triggered by the **same clock signal**, and state changes occur **simultaneously**.
* **Asynchronous Counters**: Flip-flops are **triggered independently**, often with the **output of one flip-flop** clocking the next.

---

#### Asynchronous Sequential Circuits

These are circuits that:

* Do **not use a clock** for synchronization.
* Change states **immediately** when inputs change (inputs are **levels**, not pulses).
* Are **driven directly by input events**.

##### Example: Ripple Counter

* The **first flip-flop** is clocked by an external clock.
* **Subsequent flip-flops** are clocked by the output of the previous flip-flop.
* This causes a **"ripple" effect** as state changes propagate.

---

#### Flip-Flops and the D Flip-Flop

A **flip-flop** is a basic memory element that stores **one bit** of data.

##### D Flip-Flop Overview:

* **Inputs**: `D` (Data), `CLK` (Clock)
* **Outputs**: `Q`, `Q'`
* Stores `D` into `Q` on the **rising edge** of the clock.

##### D Flip-Flop Truth Table:

| D | CLK ↑ | Q (Next) |
| - | ----- | -------- |
| 0 | ↑     | 0        |
| 1 | ↑     | 1        |

##### Timing Diagram:

* **When CLK = 0**: Master latch is **open**, passes `D` to internal latch (`QM`).
* **When CLK = 1**: Master latch **closes**, and `QM` transfers to **slave** latch.
* Ensures output changes only on the **clock edge** – flip-flop is **not transparent**.

---

#### Advantages of Asynchronous Sequential Circuits

1. **Faster** – No need to wait for a clock cycle; responds instantly to input changes.
2. **Simple** – Fewer components and no need for a clock generator.
3. **Reliable** – Independent of external timing.
4. **Power Efficient** – Lower power consumption due to reduced clock activity.
5. **Adaptable** – Reacts well to environmental input variations.
6. **Security** – Harder to tamper due to non-predictable timing.
7. **Early Completion** – Can produce output even if some inputs are irrelevant or delayed.

---

#### Summary

* **Asynchronous Counters** respond to external events without a common clock.
* **Asynchronous Sequential Circuits** change state instantly based on input levels.
* **D Flip-Flops** are fundamental memory elements used in both asynchronous and synchronous circuits.
* These circuits offer benefits such as **speed, simplicity, reliability, low power**, and **adaptability**.
