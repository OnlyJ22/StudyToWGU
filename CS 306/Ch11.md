### Computer Performance and Evaluation

#### What Is Computer Performance?

Computer performance refers to how efficiently a computer system operates. It includes the effectiveness of all its components working together to deliver desired outcomes. Evaluating computer performance means assessing a system’s resources and outputs to determine whether it's performing optimally—much like how a voltmeter checks voltage in a circuit.

#### Why Computer Performance Evaluation Is Complex

Evaluating performance isn't straightforward because it involves many parameters—such as speed, latency, and bandwidth—that vary with technology. The process requires ongoing updates due to rapid changes in hardware and software capabilities. This dynamic nature makes benchmarking a complex but essential task.

#### Key Computer Performance Parameters

#### Response Time

The total time between submitting a request and receiving a response. It’s like placing an order and waiting for delivery.

#### Latency

Latency measures the delay in data transmission—how long it takes for a message to travel from source to destination. Think of it like flight time between two cities.

#### Speed

This typically refers to **clock speed**—the number of instruction cycles the CPU can perform per second, measured in MHz or GHz. Higher speeds mean faster data processing, similar to a car with more horsepower.

#### Throughput

Throughput is the volume of data processed successfully in a given timeframe. For example, it’s like how many packages a post office can handle per day.

#### Bandwidth

Bandwidth is the **maximum** amount of data that can be transferred at once, not necessarily how much is processed. It’s like how many customers a post office can serve at the same time, depending on available counters.

#### Scalability

Scalability measures a system's ability to handle increased workload without performance degradation. For example, hiring more staff at the post office during holidays to manage extra mail.

#### Power Consumption

This refers to the amount of electrical power a computer uses. It’s like fuel consumption in cars—more efficient systems deliver better performance using less energy.

#### How Are Benchmarks Used?

Benchmarks serve as reference points to evaluate whether a system is meeting performance expectations. They may come in the form of programs or simulations that measure how the system handles workloads. Benchmarks guide upgrades and improvements by identifying underperforming areas.

Benchmarks are reference points against which the computer system's parameters are measured to see if they are functioning properly.
#### Lesson Summary

Computer performance evaluation measures how well a computer system operates across various parameters. Key performance factors include:

* **Response time** – time between request and result
* **Latency** – delay during data transmission Latency is the term used to describe the state of existence of something in transition to being developed, or manifested.
* **Speed** – instruction cycles per second (clock speed)
* **Throughput** – volume of data processed in a given time
* **Bandwidth** – max rate of data transfer
* **Scalability** – system’s ability to adapt to higher demand
* **Power consumption** – energy required for operation

Benchmarks provide a standardized way to assess performance and identify areas for improvement. However, because technology changes so quickly, benchmarks must be updated regularly to stay relevant.
