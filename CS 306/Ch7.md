## Stacks in Computer Memory | LIFO, Operations & Use Case

### **Core Concepts**

* **Stack**: Linear data structure used for memory storage
* **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**: Last inserted item is the first removed
* **Homogeneous Data**: Stack stores data of the same type
* **Access Pattern**: Insert/remove only from the top of the stack

---

### **Stack Operations**

1. **Push Operation**

   * Inserts data onto the top of the stack
   * Earlier items go to the bottom

2. **Pop Operation**

   * Removes the most recently added item
   * Follows LIFO behavior

3. **Peek Operation**

   * Views the top item without removing it
   * No modification to stack contents

4. **Search Operation**

   * Finds a specific item’s location relative to the top
   * No modification to stack contents

---

### **Example: Stack in Word Editing**

* Each formatting step (e.g., bold, italic) = pushed item
* Undo command = pops operations in reverse order
* Demonstrates practical use of LIFO in applications

---

### **Other Key Concepts**

* **Purpose**: Reduces CPU wait time by storing data closer to the processor
* **CPU Cache**: Located on or near the CPU chip, used for fast instruction and data retrieval

---

### **How CPU Cache Works**

* **Cache Hit**: Requested data is found in the cache (fast access)
* **Cache Miss**: Data not found in cache, must be retrieved from slower main memory
* **Efficiency Principle**: Smaller caches are faster and more efficient
* **Speed Tradeoff**: Larger caches = slower lookup, but hold more data

---

### **Cache Size Comparison**

* **CPU Cache**: Usually in megabytes (MB)
* **Main Memory (RAM)**: Typically 2–8 gigabytes (GB)
* **Relative Size**: Cache is \~1,000x smaller but significantly faster

---

### **Multi-Level Caches**

* **L1 Cache**:

  * Smallest, fastest
  * Accessed first by the CPU

* **L2 Cache**:

  * Larger, slightly slower
  * Accessed if L1 results in a cache miss

* **L3 Cache**:

  * Even larger, slower than L2
  * Last cache layer before main memory

* **Integration**:

  * Older systems: L1 on CPU, L2 on motherboard
  * Modern systems: L1, L2, and L3 all integrated into CPU

---

### **Other Key Concepts**

* **Web Cache vs. CPU Cache**:

  * Web cache stores webpage data locally for faster browsing
  * CPU cache stores instruction/data for processing speed

* **Optimization**:

  * **Cache Memory**: Small, high-speed memory near the CPU

* **Purpose of Cache**:

  * Stores frequently accessed/updated data
  * Enhances CPU performance by reducing data access time
  * Cached data is copied from primary memory

* **Efficiency Factors**:

  * **Proximity to CPU**: Reduces latency
  * **Limited Size**: Smaller cache = faster access
  * **Smart Selection**: Programs must determine what data benefits most from caching

---

### **Cache Mapping Strategies**

1. **Direct Mapping**

   * Primary memory divided into **pages**
   * Cache divided into **frames**
   * Uses **tag table** for direct mapping of pages to frames
   * **Pros**: Simple and fast
   * **Cons**: Collisions occur if pages share the same tag

2. **Fully Associative Mapping**

   * Uses **Content Addressable Memory (CAM)**
   * Any page can be mapped to any frame
   * **Pros**: Maximum flexibility
   * **Cons**: High processing overhead due to full table search

3. **Set Associative Mapping**

   * Cache is divided into **set blocks** (e.g., 4 sets from 256 bytes)
   * Combines **tags** and **small CAM**
   * **Pros**: Balanced efficiency and flexibility
   * **Cons**: More complex than direct mapping but more efficient than fully associative

---

### **Other Key Concepts**

* **Cached Data**: Duplicates of primary memory data stored for fast access
* **Mapping Trade-offs**: Speed vs. flexibility vs. processing overhead
* **Optimization**: Strategy selection depends on workload and hardware design

Cache Replacement Policies | Purpose, Strategies & Hit Ratio Optimization
Core Concepts
Hit Ratio: Ratio of cache hits to total memory lookups

Goal: Maximize hit ratio by smart data placement and replacement

Cache Replacement: Writing back old data to make room for new data in limited cache

Why Replacement Policies Matter
Cache is small compared to main memory

Selecting the wrong data to remove can reduce performance

Effective policies aim to avoid removing data that will be used again soon

Replacement Policies
Least Recently Used (LRU)

Replaces block not accessed for the longest time

Uses age bits to track usage time

Pros: Intelligently predicts future usage

Cons: Requires extra circuitry for tracking ages

First In, First Out (FIFO)

Replaces oldest block, regardless of usage

Simple to implement

Cons: May evict frequently used data

Random

Replaces a randomly chosen block

Easy to implement

Surprisingly efficient in many scenarios

Other Key Concepts
Cache Replacement: Involves removing one block and inserting another from higher memory

Trade-offs:

Simplicity vs. effectiveness

Predictability vs. randomness

Policy Selection: Depends on system architecture, workload, and performance needs

---

### **What Is Associative Memory?**

* **Associative Memory (Content-Addressable Memory)**:

### **Core Concepts**

* **Logisim**: Circuit simulation software used to design and test memory and logic systems
* **RAM Module**: Memory component used to store and retrieve binary data
* **Memory & Addressing**: Each memory location accessed via address pins; data is input/output via data pins

---

### **Code Application – RAM Configuration**

* **Task**: Modify RAM to **16 x 8**

  * **16** = number of addresses (requires **4-bit** address pins)
  * **8** = data bit width

* **Components to Add**:

  * **Controlled buffer** and **controlled inverter**
  * Optional: **Labels** for clarity

* **Direction Settings**:

  * **Address** pin → faces **east**
  * **Data In** pin → faces **south**
  * **Data Out** pin → faces **north** (set `Output? = Yes`)

---

### **Follow-Up Questions & Answers**

#### **1. RAM Size: 24 x 32 Configuration**

* **West (Left/A Side)**: 24-bit **Address** input
* **East (Right/D Side)**: 32-bit **Data** input/output
* Must match widths on all connected components (e.g., MUX, registers)

---

#### **2. What If Address Width Isn't Updated?**

* **Result**: Logisim shows **orange lines** with “**incompatible widths**” error
* **Fix**: Manually set **address pins** to correct bit width matching the RAM module (e.g., for 24 x 32 RAM → address pins = 24 bits)

---

#### **3. Fixing MUX and Register Width Conflicts**

* **Problem**: Connected lines in orange with “incompatible widths” warning
* **Solution**:

  * Set **PC register** to **16-bit**
  * Set **second register** to **8-bit**
  * Ensure all attached MUX and RAM match these widths exactly

---

### **Testing in Logisim**

* Use the **Poke tool** to:

  * Modify RAM values directly
  * Toggle read/write controls and observe Data Out
* RAM must be **engaged (read/write control = 1)** to function properly

---

### **Other Key Concepts**

* **Multiplexer (MUX)**: Routes one of several input signals to an output based on selector bits
* **Bit Width Matching**: Crucial for signal compatibility in digital circuits
* **Clock Pin**: Controls memory operation timing for sequential logic simulation
