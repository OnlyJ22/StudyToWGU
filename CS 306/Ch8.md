## The Instruction Set | Structure, Assembly Language & ISA Components

### **Core Concepts**

* **Instruction Set (ISA)**: The set of operations a CPU can execute; defines machine-language capabilities
* **Machine Language**: Raw binary (1s and 0s) understood by the processor
* **Assembly Language**: Human-readable code using **mnemonics** like `MOV`, `ADD`, `CMP`, assembled into machine code
* **ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)**: Framework that defines instruction formats, addressing modes, and CPU operations

---

### **Instruction Structure**

* **Instruction Length**: Varies by architecture and complexity (e.g., x86: 1‚Äì3 bytes for opcode + operand bytes)
* **Components**:

  * **Opcode**: Operation to be performed (e.g., `ADD`, `MOV`)
  * **Operands**: Data to be operated on (e.g., registers, memory values, immediate values)
  * **Addressing Mode**: Determines how operand locations are interpreted (immediate, register, memory)

---

### **Assembly Examples**

* **Immediate Value**:

  ```assembly
  mov eax, 9     ; Load 9 into register EAX
  ```

* **Register to Register**:

  ```assembly
  mov eax, ebx   ; Copy contents of EBX into EAX
  ```

---

### **Operands & Addressing Modes**

* **Immediate**: Value is included directly in the instruction
* **Register**: Operand is a CPU register (fast access)
* **Memory**: Operand is stored in main memory (slower access)

---

### **Registers vs. Main Memory**

* **Registers**:

  * Located inside CPU
  * Very fast, limited quantity
  * Used for quick computation

* **Main Memory (RAM)**:

  * Larger, slower
  * Used for general storage and large data handling

---

### **Processor Control Elements**

* **Status Flags**:

  * Bit indicators of outcomes (e.g., zero result, overflow, etc.)
  * Set or cleared during instruction execution

* **Program Counter (PC)**:

  * Keeps track of the address of the current instruction
  * Automatically updated after each instruction is executed

---

### **Other Key Concepts**

* **Mnemonics**: Human-friendly codes in assembly (e.g., `MOV`, `ADD`)
* **Instruction Efficiency**:

  * **ALU (Arithmetic/Logic Unit)** ‚Äì Performs arithmetic/logical operations
  * **CU (Control Unit)** ‚Äì Directs operation flow, manages instruction queue, and selects ALU functions

---

### **ALU Structure & Functionality**

* **Output**: 1 result, controlled via 3-state buffers
* **n-bit ALU**: Created by duplicating a 1-bit ALU *n* times
* **Operations Example**:

  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Logic AND
  * Logic NOT

---

### **Selection Logic**

* **Demultiplexer (DEMUX)**:

  * Routes control signals to the appropriate ALU operation
  * Uses **selection inputs** to enable specific function outputs

* **Instruction Encoding Example**:

  * `00` ‚Üí ADD
  * `01` ‚Üí SUB
  * `10` ‚Üí AND
  * `11` ‚Üí NOT

---

### **Machine Language & Assembly Language**

* **Machine Language**:

  * Numeric codes (binary) processed directly by the ALU
  * Input to the **demux** for selecting the ALU output

* **Assembly Language**:

  * Symbolic representation of machine language
  * Easier for humans to read and write

* **Instruction Mapping Table**:

| Numeric Code | Operation   | Assembly Code |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| 00           | Addition    | `ADD`         |
| 01           | Subtraction | `SUB`         |
| 10           | Logic AND   | `AND`         |
| 11           | Logic NOT   | `NOT`         |

---

### **Assembler**

## Endianness | Big vs. Little Endian in Memory Storage

### **Core Concepts**

* **Endianness**: Determines how **multi-byte data** is stored in memory
* **Use Case**: Important in **assembly programming**, memory access, and **processor design**
* **Types**:

  * **Big Endian** ‚Äì Most Significant Byte (MSB) stored first (lowest address)
  * **Little Endian** ‚Äì Least Significant Byte (LSB) stored first (lowest address)

---

### **How It Works**

* **32-bit word example**: `0A0B0C0D`

  * 4 bytes total:

    * **0A** (Most Significant Byte)
    * **0D** (Least Significant Byte)

---

### **Little Endian Storage**

* **Order** in memory (address `a` to `a+3`):

  ```
  a     ‚Üí 0D  
  a+1   ‚Üí 0C  
  a+2   ‚Üí 0B  
  a+3   ‚Üí 0A
  ```

---

### **Big Endian Storage**

* **Order** in memory (address `a` to `a+3`):

  ```
  a     ‚Üí 0A  
  a+1   ‚Üí 0B  
  a+2   ‚Üí 0C  
  a+3   ‚Üí 0D
  ```

---

### **Practical Example (Assembly)**

* **Instruction**: `STRW 1234, AB00CD12`

  * Stores 32-bit word starting at address `1234`

* **Reading Byte-by-Byte**:

  * `RDB 1234` returns:

    * `**12**` (if system is **Little Endian**)
    * `**AB**` (if system is **Big Endian**)

---

### **Other Key Concepts**

* **Address Significance**:

  * **Lower address** holds either LSB or MSB depending on Endianness
* **No Performance Impact**: Choice between Big/Little Endian doesn't affect speed
* **Documentation Required**: Crucial for cross-system compatibility and memory debugging

4. **Processor 4 ‚Äì 0-Address (Stack-Based)**

   * Example: `ADD` (Top of stack operations)
   * All operands implicit (stack)
   * Instruction size: 4 bits

---

### **Expression Example: Z = (A + B\*C) / (A - D)**

| Processor      | Lines | Program Size |
| -------------- | ----- | ------------ |
| **1 (3-addr)** | 4     | 64 bits      |
| **2 (2-addr)** | 8     | 96 bits      |
| **3 (1-addr)** | 8     | 64 bits      |
| **4 (stack)**  | 10    | 40 bits      |

---

### **Key Takeaways**
