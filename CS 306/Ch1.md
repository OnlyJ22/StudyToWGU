| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Keyboard Input**   | User presses keys → converted to ASCII                  |
| **2. Input Port**       | Keyboard data enters via serial/USB port                |
| **3. CPU**              | Reassembles bits → sends characters to system bus       |
| **4. System Bus**       | Transfers data between components                       |
| **5. RAM**              | Holds OS, word processor, and bit-mapped text buffer    |

**3 How does the monitor control the color of the text displayed?**
The bit-mapped data buffer also contains data to construct the red-green-blue (RGB) color levels of each pixel of the monitor. This allows the word processor to change the colors of our text and display it.

**Which computer component is responsible for moving a keyboard character to random-access memory (RAM)?**
The CPU performs the synchronization necessary to use the system bus to move the keyboard character received on the serial input/output port to RAM.

**How much data is the input/output serial port on a computer capable of transferring from the keyboard to the CPU at a time?**
The microprocessor in the keyboard detects each key press and release to construct the appropriate character and transfers the character one bit at a time to the CPU.

**How does the keyboard capture keystrokes?**
The keyboard contains a microprocessor that continually monitors all key presses and releases to interpret and turn them into an ASCII value. These values are then sent to the input port.

**The OS is the first to be notified by the system bus that data has been received. The CPU synchronizes the exchange, and the OS receives the text. The OS instructions then move the text to the word processor; once it reaches the RAM, how is text displayed on the monitor?**
The word processor copies it to the display bit-map.

**The system buses found in a computer are:**
The control bus, the data bus and the address bus.

#### Cloud-Based Platforms

* **Definition**: Business or organization runs computing systems on **remote infrastructure**.
* **Access**: Via Internet or private network.
* **Advantages**:

  * Reduces need for on-site infrastructure.
  * Scales with demand.
  * Often subscription-based or pay-per-use.

---

#### Platform Evolution

* **Microcomputer**: Outdated term; now commonly referred to as a personal computer (PC).
* **Performance Shift**:

  * Today’s smartphones and low-end laptops outperform 1980s mainframes.
  * **Parallel computing** (e.g., clusters of PCs) can mimic or exceed minicomputer performance.

---

#### Summary

* A **computer platform** = hardware + operating system.
* Platform **type and size** should match the complexity of the task.

  * **PCs** for individual use.
  * **Minicomputers** for business-scale processing.
  * **Mainframes** for enterprise-level data handling.
  * **Cloud-based platforms** for remote, scalable access to computing resources.

### Computing Systems

#### Core Components of a Computing System

A **basic computing system** includes:

* **CPU**: Central Processing Unit (the brain)
* **Memory**: Temporary workspace for programs and data
* **Input Unit**: Receives user data (e.g., keyboard, mouse)
* **Output Unit**: Sends results to the user (e.g., monitor, printer)
* **Bus**: Communication pathways between components; supports **uni-directional** and **bi-directional** data flow.

---

#### Importance of Memory

* Memory provides the **workspace** for the CPU.
* A powerful CPU without sufficient memory is ineffective (like a worker without desk space).
* Programs must be loaded into memory to run, and results must be stored to be used or viewed.

---

#### Historical Context

* **Early Systems**:

  * Used **punched cards** for input, output, and storage.
  * Programs and data were physically separated.
* **Advancement**:

  * Introduction of **electronic read-write memory** allowed development of **general-purpose computers**.
  * Enabled programmable systems capable of solving multiple tasks.

---

#### von Neumann Architecture

* **Proposed by**: John von Neumann
* **Key Feature**: **Single memory** space stores both **data** and **instructions**.
* **Advantages**:

  * Enables programs to treat other programs as data.
  * Foundation for modern **operating systems**.
* **Limitation**:

  * **von Neumann bottleneck**:

    * Memory is slower than CPU.
    * Only one memory transaction at a time via one bus.
    * CPU often waits while fetching data.

---

#### Harvard Architecture

* **Key Feature**: Uses **two separate memory spaces** for data and instructions.
* **Structure**:

  * Two memory modules.
  * Two separate buses to the CPU.
* **Advantages**:

  * Allows **simultaneous memory transactions**.
  * Fetches data and executes instructions concurrently.
  * Eliminates von Neumann bottleneck.

#### Architectural Comparison

| **Feature**      | **von Neumann Architecture**                  | **Harvard Architecture**                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Memory Structure | Single memory space for data and instructions | Separate memory for data and instructions                |
| Bus System       | One shared bus                                | Two separate buses                                       |
| Performance      | Slower due to bottleneck                      | Faster with concurrent data/instruction access           |
| Flexibility      | Supports OS and self-modifying programs       | Better speed, less flexible for program-data interaction |
| Use Case         | General-purpose computing                     | High-performance embedded or specialized systems         |

---

#### Summary

* A **computing system** includes a CPU, memory, input, and output units.
* **von Neumann architecture** is flexible and enabled the development of OSs but suffers from a **memory access bottleneck**.
* **Harvard architecture** improves performance by **separating data and instruction memory**, allowing **parallel memory access**.
* **Choice of architecture** depends on the **needs of the application**—flexibility vs. speed.
