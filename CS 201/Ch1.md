### Section 1: Defining Pseudocode

#### What Is Pseudocode?

**Pseudocode** is a simplified way of writing **program logic** in plain English before translating it into an actual programming language. It is **not executable code**, and it doesn't follow the syntax of any specific programming language.

Instead, pseudocode helps **plan, structure, and visualize** a program before coding begins.

> Think of pseudocode as a **blueprint**:
> You lay out your ideas step by step, so you're not coding blindly.

#### Why Use Pseudocode?

* Helps **organize** thoughts before coding
* Makes it easier to **catch errors early**
* Easier to **modify** than code
* More readable and **language-independent**
* Ideal for **team collaboration** and **documentation**

In the past, programmers relied heavily on **flowcharts**, but those became too difficult to maintain. Pseudocode offers a **flexible, text-based alternative**.

#### Examples of Pseudocode

**Example 1 — Add Two Numbers**

```
Start Program  
Enter two numbers, A and B  
Add the numbers together  
Print the sum  
End Program
```

**Example 2 — Area of a Rectangle**

```
Get the length, l, and width, w  
Compute area = l * w  
Display area
```

**Example 3 — Perimeter of a Rectangle**

```
Enter length, l  
Enter width, w  
Compute perimeter = 2 * l + 2 * w  
Display perimeter
```

#### Key Guidelines for Writing Pseudocode

To keep pseudocode clear and effective, follow these basic rules:

1. **Avoid Language-Specific Syntax**

   * Don't use code keywords like `System.out.println()` or `cin >>`
   * Write in plain English (e.g., `Display result`, `Input grade`)

2. **One Task per Line**

   * Avoid combining steps on a single line
   * This improves readability and reduces confusion

3. **Capitalize Keywords**

   * Highlight actions such as `READ`, `WRITE`, `DISPLAY`, `IF`, `ELSE`, `WHILE`
   * Makes logic flow easier to recognize

4. **Indent Loops and Conditions**

   * Enhances visual structure
   * Makes nested logic easier to follow

**Example — Check if Grade Is Passing**

```
Enter grade  
IF grade < 70  
    DISPLAY "Failing"  
ELSE  
    DISPLAY "Passing"
```

#### Pseudocode Editors

You can write pseudocode using any **basic text editor** like Notepad or Word. However, there are **specialized editors** that support pseudocode and may also help convert it into actual code for languages like Java or C++.

While **pseudocode is not standardized**, some organizations use internal formatting rules to maintain consistency across teams.

#### Lesson Summary

* **Pseudocode** is an informal, plain-English method of outlining how a program should work.
* It's a **universal tool**, applicable to any programming language.
* It’s used for **planning**, **error-checking**, and **collaboration** before actual code is written.
* Follow four main rules:

  * Avoid language-specific commands
  * One task per line
  * Capitalize keywords
  * Indent loop or condition logic
* Pseudocode is flexible and easy to modify — making it a **powerful tool for development planning**.
