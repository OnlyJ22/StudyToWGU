### Section 2: Database Security Management

---

#### üîê **What Is Database Security Management?**

* Defined as the **processes and protocols** used to protect databases from **unauthorized access, malicious attacks, and operational failures**.
* Ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of data across all stages: at rest, in use, and in transit.
* Critical for any data-driven institution‚Äîespecially in sectors like **banking, healthcare, and government**.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Key Threats to Database Security**

| Threat Type           | Description                                                                          |

---

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Core Security Mechanisms**

1. **Encryption**

   * Scrambles data into unreadable format using a **key**.
   * Protects **data at rest** and **in transit** from unauthorized access.

2. **Authentication & Authorization**

   * Restricts access to **verified users** using ID-password combos.
   * **User roles** define what data each user can access or modify.

3. **Data Views**

   * Implements **role-based visibility**: e.g., tellers see balances, managers see full history.

4. **Audit Trails**

   * Records every interaction with the database‚Äî**who accessed what and when**.
   * Crucial for tracing **fraudulent or unauthorized activity**.

5. **Backups**

   * Ensure **recovery of lost data** following a breach or failure.
   * Must be stored securely and updated regularly.

---

#### üìù **Lesson Summary**

Database security management is **vital to preserving trust and functionality** in data-driven operations. It protects against threats from both inside and outside the organization, using a **layered defense strategy** that includes encryption, access control, audit logs, and regular backups. As data volume and digital exposure increase, so does the need for **skilled DBAs and robust security protocols**.

### Section 3: Database Security Using SQL Permissions and Stored Procedures

---

#### üîë **Who Has Access? SQL Security Overview**

* Database security isn't just about firewalls‚Äî**SQL commands** control access.
* Use **GRANT**/**REVOKE** to grant or remove privileges.
* Use **roles** for group-based permissions.
* **Stored procedures** hide table logic and help prevent SQL injection.

---

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Controlling Access with GRANT and REVOKE**

**Grant Access**

```sql
GRANT SELECT
ON tblCustomers
TO 'Jane Doe';
```

| Privilege Type | Description           |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| `ALL`          | Full access           |
| `SELECT`       | Read/query data       |
| `EXECUTE`      | Run stored procedures |

**Revoke Access**

```sql
REVOKE SELECT
ON tblCustomers
FROM 'Jane Doe';
```

Use this to immediately remove access for departing users or role changes.

---

#### üë• **Using Roles for Access Control**

1. **Create Role and Assign Privileges**

```sql
CREATE ROLE qa_tester;
GRANT CREATE TABLE TO qa_tester;
GRANT qa_tester TO 'Jane Doe';
```

2. **Drop Role (Removes Access from All)**

```sql
DROP ROLE qa_tester;
```

Use roles for streamlined permission management.

---

#### üßæ **Stored Procedures: Controlled Access to Data**

* Stored procedures encapsulate SQL operations.
* Users run procedures without direct table access‚Äîgreat for security and injection prevention.

**Example Stored Procedure**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE spGetCustomers
AS
BEGIN
  DECLARE @customerName VARCHAR(100);
  PRINT 'Customers';
  SET @customerName = 'Jane Eyre';
  PRINT @customerName;
END;
GO
```

---

#### üö´ **SQL Injection Protection**

| Threat              | Mitigation                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SQL Injection       | Use stored procedures instead of raw SQL         |
| Unauthorized SELECT | Deny SELECT, use EXECUTE on procedures           |
| Schema Tampering    | Restrict DML operations to controlled interfaces |

---

#### üìù **Lesson Summary**

* Use `GRANT`/`REVOKE` to manage access privileges.
* Employ roles for efficient permission control.
* Leverage stored procedures to encapsulate logic and enforce secure access.
* Stored procedures help prevent SQL injection.
* Proper SQL-based permission practices enhance **security**, **compliance**, and **maintainability**.

### Section 4: SQL Injection

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **What Is SQL Injection?**

* Occurs when untrusted user input is embedded directly into an SQL query, allowing attackers to manipulate the query logic.
* Common in web apps backed by relational databases that fail to properly sanitize inputs.

---

#### üß© **Conditions That Enable SQL Injection**

1. A database backend that executes SQL queries.
2. User input is directly included in SQL commands without proper validation or parameterization.

---

#### üîì **Common Attack Techniques**

##### 1. **Always-True Injection**

```sql
SELECT name, pwd, account_number
FROM user_table
WHERE name = '[input]' AND pwd = '[input]' OR 1=1;
```

* Injecting `OR 1=1` makes the WHERE clause always true, exposing all user data.

##### 2. **UNION-Based Injection**

```sql
... WHERE name = '[input]' AND pwd = '[input]'
UNION
SELECT 1 FROM all_tables;
```

* The attacker appends a `UNION` query to merge sensitive data from other tables into the result.

---

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Preventive Measures**

##### ‚úÖ 1. Input Validation

* Enforce rules: data type, format, length, allowed characters/values.
* Reject suspicious inputs like `OR 1=1` or SQL keywords.

##### ‚úÖ 2. Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements

* Separate code from data.
* Example (pseudo-code):

```sql
SELECT name, pwd, account_number
FROM user_table
WHERE name = ? AND pwd = ?;
```

##### ‚úÖ 3. Query Validation/Sanitization

* Parse intended SQL before execution.
* Detect and block malicious constructs like `UNION`, `--`, or `; DROP`.

---

#### üìù **Lesson Summary**

* SQL injection allows attackers to inject malicious SQL via form inputs.
* It can enable data theft (`OR 1=1`) or structural manipulation (`UNION`).
* Prevention requires **validation**, **parameterization**, and **query verification** to preserve both security and data integrity.

### Section 5: Cascading Permissions, Database Inference, and Statistical Databases

---

#### üîê **Cascading Permissions**

* Permissions can **cascade from a parent role** (e.g., Owner) to child roles (e.g., Manager, Admin).
* This allows for **centralized access control** while still customizing permissions for each role.

##### üîÑ Key Concepts:

* **Parent Role**: Has full permissions.
* **Child Role**: Inherits permissions from the parent but can have **custom restrictions**.
* Revoking permissions **on the child** does not affect the parent.

##### üîß Configuration Steps:

1. **Create Parent Role**
2. **Grant permissions to Parent**
3. **Create Child Role with INHERIT**
4. **Assign permissions from Parent to Child**
5. **Customize Child‚Äôs exceptions (restricted fields/tables)**

---

#### üïµÔ∏è **Database Inference**

* **Database inference** occurs when a user deduces unauthorized information using **related accessible data**.
* Even without direct access, **aggregate data + context** can reveal sensitive values.

##### Example:

* Kayle doesn't access Deanna‚Äôs sales table.
* But using:

  * Known job roles ("Sales Lead")
  * Count of those roles
  * Aggregate sales data
* He estimates individual performance with high accuracy.

---

#### üìä **Statistical Databases**

* **Statistical databases** are designed to **limit inference attacks** by only allowing **aggregate-level access** and suppressing identifying data.

##### üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Techniques:

* Only **aggregate queries** are allowed.
* Restrict **WHERE clauses** to reduce query granularity.
* Return **fuzzy counts** (e.g., show 30 when result is 45).
* Show **ranges instead of exact values** (e.g., "\$38K‚Äì\$42K" instead of "\$40K").

---

#### üìù **Lesson Summary**

* **Cascading Permissions** allow child roles to inherit from parent roles but can be customized.
* **Database Inference** enables users to extract private data through analysis of aggregate and accessible data.
* **Statistical Databases** help prevent inference attacks by masking detail and altering how data is returned in queries.

### Section 6: Query Restrictions, Data Partitioning, and Data Perturbation

---

#### üîê **Query Restrictions**

* **Users can be limited** to access data only through **stored procedures**.
* Prevents direct table access‚Äî**no INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE** outside pre-approved queries.
* Useful for separating **application layer logic** from raw data access.

##### üîß Example Use Case:

* A user role `admin-restrict` can run:

  ```sql
  SELECT user_name, start_date FROM employee;
  ```

* But **cannot access** columns like `date_of_birth` or `salary`.

---

#### üóÇÔ∏è **Database Partitioning**

* Partitioning enhances **data manageability** and **access control**.

| Partition Type | Description                                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Horizontal** | Divides rows: e.g., ID 1‚Äì1500 in one table, 1501‚Äì3000 in another           |
| **Vertical**   | Divides columns: e.g., separate table for sensitive fields like SSN or DOB |

##### üîê Security Perks:

* Encrypt sensitive vertical partitions with **stronger keys**.
* Apply **role-based access** to specific partitions only.

---

#### üé≤ **Data Perturbation**

* Used to **obfuscate sensitive data** while retaining statistical properties.

| Method                       | Description                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Probability Distribution** | Replace original with a dataset having similar statistical distribution    |
| **Value Distortion**         | Add "noise" via random values (additive, multiplicative, etc.)             |
| **Geometric Perturbation**   | Combine transformations: translation, rotation, and noise for max security |

##### üîí Use Case:

* Helps protect against **data mining** and inference attacks.
* Makes data unreadable without knowledge of **perturbation formula**.

---

#### üìù **Lesson Summary**

* **Query Restrictions** enforce read-only or filtered access via stored procedures.
* **Database Partitioning** splits data into manageable units‚Äîuseful for performance and granular security.
* **Data Perturbation** protects data via randomness, enabling privacy-preserving data analysis.
* These techniques bolster **advanced security** without sacrificing utility for trusted users.

### Section 7: Database Encryption

---

#### üîê **Encryption Overview**

* Encryption converts **plaintext into unreadable cipher text** using mathematical algorithms.
* Protects data from unauthorized access, especially during cyberattacks.

---

#### üß™ **Encryption Methods**

##### 1. **Transparent (External) Encryption**

* Encrypts data at rest‚Äî**entire database and backups**‚Äîwith a single key.
* Transparent to applications; **decryption happens in memory**.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk: Key compromise exposes all data; decrypted data in cache is still vulnerable.

##### 2. **Column-Level Encryption**

* Encrypts **individual columns** with separate keys.
* Enhances **data granularity and protection**.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance trade-off due to encryption overhead on search/index functions.

##### 3. **Symmetric Encryption**

* One **private key** encrypts and decrypts data.
* ‚úÖ Simple and fast.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è High risk if the key is leaked.

##### 4. **Asymmetric Encryption**

* Uses a **public key for encryption**, and a **private key for decryption**.
* ‚úÖ Provides **individualized security** per user.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower due to complex key management.

##### 5. **Application-Level Encryption**

* Data is encrypted **before entering the database**‚Äîhandled by the application.
* ‚úÖ Double-layer protection; allows **differential key usage** via encryption plug-ins.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex to manage if multiple apps use different keys.

---

#### üîë **Key Management**

* **Key loss = total data loss**; recovery must be planned in advance.
* Use **key vaults** or secure modules to store keys.
* Role-based access to keys ensures **minimum privilege exposure**.

---

#### üìù **Lesson Summary**

* Choose between transparent, column-level, symmetric, asymmetric, and application-level encryption based on **data sensitivity and system design**.
* Combine encryption layers for **robust defense**.
* Secure, manage, and audit encryption keys to **preserve access and prevent breaches**.
