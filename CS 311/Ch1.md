### Section 1: Artificial Intelligence (AI)

#### What Is Artificial Intelligence?

* **Artificial intelligence (AI)** is the ability of a computer to perform tasks similar to human learning and decision making.
* The term also refers to the **study, science, and engineering** of intelligent machines, systems, and programs.
* AI encompasses a wide array of fields including **machine learning, robotics, natural language processing, and more**.
* The study of AI includes both **theoretical** and **applied** aspects.

#### Brief History

* The **roots of AI** go back to the 1940s, motivated by technological advancements during World War II.
* Pioneers like **Alan Turing** (mathematician) and **Grey Walter** (neurologist) initiated ideas on intelligent machines.
* The term **"artificial intelligence"** was coined by **John McCarthy** in the 1950s.

  * During this time, **Marvin Minsky**'s approach of pre-programming intelligence dominated the field.
  * Significant funding was granted for AI research, especially for national interests.
* **Firsts in AI:**

  * **Shakey** (late 1960s): The first mobile decision-making robot, able to map surroundings but slow in processing.
* **AI Winter:**

  * In the 1970s, following critical assessments (e.g., Sir James Lighthill), funding was drastically cut, stalling development.
* **Renewed Progress:**

  * 1980s: AI regained funding for specific commercial uses, especially in business applications.
  * 1990s: A shift occurred from **pre-programmed rules** to **learning systems** (neural networks), influenced by **Rodney Brooks**.

    * Neural networks, inspired by brain cell function, allowed AIs to learn behaviors rather than follow set rules.
    * Brooks' company developed the first widely used home robot: the **Roomba vacuum**.

#### Current State and Future

* **Modern AI applications:**

  * **Robotics**: Examples include BigDog (military pack animal) and PackBot (bomb disposal robot).
  * **Speech Recognition**: Cell phones adapt to users’ voices and improve over time.
  * **Game Show AI**: **Watson** (by IBM) outperformed Jeopardy champions and is now used in medical decision support.
* **AI’s societal reach:**
  AI now influences **military, entertainment, personal technology, transportation, medicine, and more**.

  * Examples: Self-driving cars, real-time translation, smart home devices.
* **Possible futures for AI:**

  * AI may be **integrated into humans** (enhancing strength, speed, intelligence).
  * **Supercomputers** could tackle complex global issues (e.g., climate change).
  * Intelligent machines may become deeply personalized, perhaps forming unique bonds with people.
  * Debate continues over whether machines can achieve “true” intelligence; definitions of intelligence remain unsettled.
  * So far, AI excels in specific, limited tasks (e.g., chess), but lags in complex, flexible human abilities (e.g., broad conversation).
  * The boundary between AI and humans may blur in the future, possibly merging over time.

#### Summary

* **Artificial intelligence (AI)** enables computers to perform tasks that mimic human learning and decision making, though often within a limited domain.
* AI’s history began in the **1940s** (Turing, Walter), with major milestones including the **1950s** (McCarthy coins the term, Minsky’s work), **1980s** (commercial uses), and explosive growth in the **1990s** and **2000s** (neural networks, Watson, speech recognition, robotics).
* The **current state of AI** includes widespread use in everyday technology, and its **future** remains open for innovation and debate.

### Section 2: Dabbling in Artificial Intelligence

#### AI in Popular Culture

* The **Jetsons**, a cartoon from the 1960s and 1980s, envisioned a futuristic world with flying cars and robot housekeepers.
* Many of these futuristic ideas are now reality:

  * **Tesla** is developing self-driving cars.
  * **Smartphones** can understand verbal commands.
  * **iRobot Roomba** vacuums autonomously clean homes, reminiscent of Rosie the robot maid.
* Everyday technology incorporates intelligence:

  * **Amazon** uses algorithms to recommend products tailored to individual users.

#### What Is Artificial Intelligence?

* **Artificial intelligence (AI)** is an arm of computer science focused on enabling computers to mimic human characteristics, perform human-like tasks, and simulate human thought.
* The term was first introduced by **John McCarthy** (Stanford researcher) in the mid-1950s.
* AI’s purpose is to create machines that can **think, learn, and behave like people**.

#### Types of Artificial Intelligence

* AI can be categorized into four main types:

  * **Reactive Machines**

    * Machines built for a single, specialized purpose.
    * Can analyze situations and make decisions, but do not learn from past experiences.
    * Example: **Google's AlphaGo** defeated top human Go players but cannot perform other tasks like checking the weather.
  * **Limited Memory**

    * Machines use past information to inform present decisions.
    * Example: **Self-driving cars** recognize and remember road features and obstacles to improve navigation.
  * **Theory of Mind**

    * AI that understands and responds to human thoughts and emotions.
    * These machines can adapt behavior based on social context.
    * Example: **Pepper**, a Japanese robot, recognizes and reacts to human emotions, displaying behaviors like dancing to music or showing fear.
  * **Self-Awareness**

    * The most advanced AI, possessing consciousness and self-understanding.
    * Able to reflect, recognize itself, and modify actions accordingly.
    * Example: New York researchers programmed robots to complete the **Wise Men logic puzzle**. One robot recognized its own voice and changed its answer after realizing it could speak—a demonstration of self-awareness.

#### Summary

* **Artificial intelligence** enables computers to adopt human characteristics, handle tasks that typically require human intelligence, and simulate emotional and logical responses.
* AI is increasingly integrated into daily life, from household devices to online services.
* The four main types of AI are **reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind, and self-awareness**, each representing a step closer to truly intelligent and adaptable machines.

### Section 3: Avoiding Boredom

#### The Challenge of Repetitive Tasks

* People tend to dislike mundane or repetitive activities, whether physical (e.g., mowing the lawn, walking the dog, washing dishes) or digital (e.g., research, repetitive computer tasks).
* Repetitive computer tasks can become frustrating and boring, driving the need for solutions that automate these activities.

#### What is an Automated Online Search Tool?

* An **Automated Online Search Tool** is an application designed to automatically collect information from multiple Internet-based sources based on user-defined criteria and schedules.
* These tools function similarly to Google but add configurability for search parameters and timing.
* Examples include:

  * **Google Alerts**: Well-known tool with configurable criteria and scheduling.
  * **Yotify**: Similar to Google Alerts but offers greater precision, including specifying particular websites.
  * **Alerts.com**: User-friendly, allowing creation of custom widgets for searches.
  * **Twitter**: Can be set to continually search for chatter matching specific criteria.
  * **WatchThatPage**: Monitors selected webpages and sends email notifications when new information appears.

#### What is an Intelligent Agent?

* An **Intelligent Agent** (or bot) is software that performs tasks or gathers information **without direct user intervention**.
* These agents are typically configurable and can perform a wide variety of functions.
* Examples:

  * **Home alarm system**: Contacts monitoring service automatically if a problem is detected.
  * **Furnace automation**: Switches between heating and cooling based on temperature.
* **Intelligent Agents** are designed to automate tasks that are either mundane or prone to human error, ensuring accuracy and timely action.

#### Differences Between Automated Online Search Tools and Intelligent Agents

* Both Automated Search Tools and Intelligent Agents can gather and deliver information from specified sources on a scheduled basis.
* **Key difference**: Intelligent Agents can **perform actions** beyond just collecting information.

  * Example: In a factory, an Intelligent Agent can turn off a furnace at scheduled intervals or remotely unlock a door at your home.
  * Automated Online Search Tools are limited to gathering information and cannot take further action.

#### Summary

* An **Automated Online Search Tool** automatically collects information from internet sources based on defined criteria and timing (e.g., Google Alerts, Yotify, Alerts.com, Twitter, WatchThatPage).
* An **Intelligent Agent** is a configurable piece of software that can perform tasks or gather information without user intervention and can take actions based on its programming.
* The main distinction is that **Intelligent Agents** can do more than just gather data—they can also act on that data or control other systems.

### Section 4: Understanding Logarithms

#### Logarithms and Exponentials

* **Logarithms** are the inverse operation of exponentials.
* They allow us to solve exponential equations by answering the question: *what exponent turns the base into a given number?*

  * Example: To solve $2^x = 34,359,738,368$, ask: "What exponent turns 2 into 34,359,738,368?"

    * $\log_2(34,359,738,368) = 35$ because $2^{35} = 34,359,738,368$.
* Logarithmic and exponential forms express the same relationship:

  * **Logarithmic form**: $\log_b(y) = x$
  * **Exponential form**: $b^x = y$

#### Common Logarithm Misconceptions

* The small number beneath the log (the *base*) is a **subscript** and not a multiplier or exponent.
* Every logarithm has a base, indicating the type of log being calculated.

#### Example Problems

* **Problem #1:** $\log_5(25)$

  * What exponent turns 5 into 25? $5^2 = 25$, so the answer is **2**.
* **Problem #2:** $\log_3(27)$

  * What exponent turns 3 into 27? $3^3 = 27$, so the answer is **3**.
* **Problem #3:** $\log_9(1)$

  * Any number to the 0 power is 1: $9^0 = 1$, so the answer is **0**.
* **Problem #4:** $\log_2(1/8)$

  * $2^{-3} = 1/8$, so the answer is **-3**.

#### Log Base 10 and Natural Log

* Two special logarithms are used most often:

  * **Base 10 logarithm:** $\log_{10}(x)$, written as **log**
  * **Natural logarithm:** $\log_e(x)$, written as **ln**, where $e \approx 2.718281$
* **Examples:**

  * $\log(100) = 2$ (means $\log_{10}(100)$)
  * $\ln(5) = \log_e(5)$

#### Change of Base Formula

* Used to calculate logarithms with bases not available on a calculator.
* **Formula:** $\log_b(a) = \frac{\log_z(a)}{\log_z(b)}$, where $z$ is any base your calculator supports (commonly 10 or $e$).

  * **Example:** $\log_2(5) = \frac{\log_{10}(5)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx 2.3$
* This formula allows us to compute logs of any base using log or ln buttons on calculators.

#### Summary

* **Logarithmic form ($\log_b(y) = x$)** and **exponential form ($b^x = y$)** are equivalent.
* Logs answer the question: "What exponent turns the base into the target number?"
* For logs with non-integer results, use the **change of base formula** and your calculator.
* The two most common calculator logs are **log (base 10)** and **ln (base $e$)**.

### Section 5: Probability Basics

#### What is Probability?

* **Probability** is a number between 0 and 1 representing the likelihood of an event occurring.

  * Probability of 0: the event cannot occur.
  * Probability of 1: the event will certainly occur.
* If you calculate a probability less than 0 or greater than 1, there is an error.

#### Visualizing Probability

* The simplest way to visualize probability is as a **fraction**:

  * **Formula:** Probability = (Number of desirable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)
  * Example: The chance of rolling an odd number on a 6-sided die = 3 (odd numbers) / 6 (total) = 0.5

* Probability notation:

  * **P(A):** Probability of event A.
  * **P(A|B):** Probability of event A **given** event B occurs.
  * **P(not A):** Probability that event A does **not** occur.

#### Probability Rules

1. **Addition Rule:**
   $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)$

   * If A and B are **mutually exclusive** (cannot happen together):
     $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)$

2. **Multiplication Rule:**
   $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$ or $P(B) \times P(A|B)$

   * If A and B are **independent** (do not affect each other):
     $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)$
   * Example: Probability of tails on first coin flip and heads on second = $0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25$

3. **Complement Rule:**
   $P(\text{not } A) = 1 - P(A)$

   * P(A) and P(not A) are mutually exclusive and together cover all possibilities:
     $P(A) + P(\text{not } A) = 1$
   * Example: If the chance of rain is 0.3, chance of no rain is $1 - 0.3 = 0.7$

#### Law of Total Probability

* **Formula:**
  $P(A) = P(A|B) \times P(B) + P(A|\text{not }B) \times P(\text{not }B)$
* Example:

  * Left-handed: 10% of population, 30% like blue.
  * Right-handed: 90% of population, 40% like blue.
  * Calculation:
    $P(\text{Blue}) = (0.1)(0.3) + (0.9)(0.4) = 0.03 + 0.36 = 0.39$
  * Therefore, the probability of a person's favorite color being blue is **39%**.

#### Bayes' Theorem

* **Formula:**
  $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}$
* Expanded with total probability for $P(B)$:
  $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\text{not }A) \times P(\text{not }A)}$
* Example:

  * Drug test: 95% accurate, 1% athletes cheat.
  * Calculation:

    1. $P(\text{Cheat|Positive}) = \frac{0.95 \times 0.01}{0.95 \times 0.01 + 0.05 \times 0.99}$
    2. $= \frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + 0.0495}$
    3. $= \frac{0.0095}{0.059} = 0.161$
  * Even with a positive test, there is only a **16.1%** chance the athlete actually cheated; **83%** chance the athlete did nothing wrong.

#### Summary

* Probability is a value between **0 and 1** and describes the likelihood of events.
* **Mutually exclusive events** cannot happen together. **Independent events** do not affect each other.
* Three core rules: **addition, multiplication, and complement.**

  * **Addition:** $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)$
  * **Multiplication:** $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$ or $P(B) \times P(A|B)$
  * **Complement:** $P(\text{not }A) = 1 - P(A)$
* **Law of total probability** and **Bayes’ theorem** provide tools for more complex probability problems, especially when dealing with conditional or incomplete information.

### Section 6: Why Evaluate Data?

#### Importance of Evaluating Data

* Evaluating data is essential in both reviewing your own scientific work and interpreting others’ research.
* **Trustworthy data** are critical for informed decisions, scientific credibility, and highlighting areas that may need improvement in your study.
* Scientific data often influence **policy decisions**, so accuracy and quality are vital.

#### Replication and Error Identification

* **Replication**—repeating steps or entire experiments—provides additional information and helps detect errors.
* Getting different results upon replication does not always mean your data are “bad,” but it can reveal possible sources of error.

#### Accuracy vs Precision

* **Accuracy:** How close a measurement is to the ‘true’ value.

  * Example: Hitting the bullseye in darts means high accuracy.
  * Measuring a chemical volume of 59 ml when the true value is 60 ml is considered accurate.
* **Precision:** The agreement of repeated measurements under the same conditions (reproducibility or repeatability).

  * Example: Hitting the same spot on the dartboard every time, even if it’s not the bullseye, is precise but not accurate.
  * Measuring 75 ml every time (when the true value is 60 ml) is precise but not accurate.
* **Both Accuracy and Precision:** Measurements are both close to the true value and consistently repeated.
* **Neither:** Measurements are far from the true value and inconsistent.

#### Types of Error

* **Human Error:** Mistakes such as spilling, equipment misuse, or forgetting steps.
* **Random Error:**

  * Occurs unpredictably in space and time.
  * Results vary with no pattern; can reduce precision.
  * Tends to cancel out over many measurements, improving accuracy through repetition.
* **Systematic Error:**

  * Related to instrument issues (e.g., uncalibrated scales, faulty pipettes).
  * Leads to consistent, repeatable error—precise but inaccurate data.
  * Example: Instrument “drift” where readings slowly change over time.
  * Drift can significantly impact calculations; regular recalibration is necessary.

#### Summary

* **Reporting credible data** is crucial, as scientific work may inform new research or policy.
* Evaluating for **accuracy and precision** builds trust in results.

  * **Accuracy:** Closeness to the true value.
  * **Precision:** Repeatability of results.
* **Random error** is unavoidable but manageable with repeated trials.
* **Systematic error** must be minimized through calibration and instrument maintenance.
* Understanding and managing errors helps ensure your data are both credible and useful for future work.

### Section 7: Our Fascination with Inanimate Intellect

#### Human Curiosity and Intelligent Objects

* Humans have long been fascinated by creating objects that can mimic life—speaking, moving, flying, and even demonstrating forethought or intelligence.
* Talking toys captivate children, while adults are intrigued by computers and games that can outsmart people.
* Today, **advanced technologies** are common:

  * Human-like robots perform tasks.
  * Airplanes fly themselves using autopilot.
  * Intelligent probes explore space with human-like techniques.
* As technology advances, there’s ongoing debate: are we simply recreating ourselves—or even replacing ourselves?

#### Intelligence vs. Smart Programming

* The **difference between intelligence and smart programming** is debated.

  * If an object only does exactly what it’s told, is it truly intelligent?
  * Technologies once called “intelligent” are now often viewed as examples of sophisticated programming.

#### What is Machine Learning?

* **Machine Learning** is a technology that enables computers to execute processes **without being explicitly programmed** for every situation.
* These systems perceive their environment, respond to new situations, make predictions, and take actions to achieve their goals.
* Example:

  * Recommendation systems on websites suggest news, products, or movies based on past user behavior.

#### Types of Machine Learning

* **Supervised Machine Learning**

  * The computer uses a labeled set of training data to learn and make accurate inferences when it encounters new data.
  * New predictions are made based on patterns recognized in the training phase.
* **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

  * The computer maps out patterns and relationships from unlabelled or randomly presented data.
  * It discovers realistic predictions and groupings without explicit instruction.

#### What is Artificial Intelligence?

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a branch of computer science focused on simulating human intelligence in machines.
* Core components of AI include:

  * Sensing
  * Language understanding
  * Problem-solving
  * Reasoning
  * Acting

#### Machine Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence

* **Machine Learning** is considered a **subset of AI**.

  * AI includes many branches and subsets; machine learning is among the most advanced.
  * The goal in both fields: create systems that simulate human intelligence and expertise.
* **Distinctions:**

  * Traditional AI relied on rule-based algorithms; these are less often considered "intelligent" today.
  * Machine learning systems **teach themselves** and adapt, making them more dynamic.
* Rapidly evolving technology means today’s intelligent machines may soon be outdated, but continuous innovation ensures that machine learning remains at the forefront.

#### Summary

* Programming machines with intelligence has long helped humans achieve tasks faster and more accurately.
* **Artificial Intelligence** is here to stay, but the biggest challenge is creating machines that truly learn and adapt to changing environments.
* **Machine Learning** represents the highest form of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to adapt, retrain, and reinvent themselves as their environments evolve.

### Section 8: David Perkins and Intelligence

#### Origins and Background

* In 1967, David Perkins—while pursuing a doctorate in mathematics and artificial intelligence at MIT—became a founding member of Project Zero at Harvard.
* Project Zero embarked on a 25-year mission to explore learning processes in children, adults, and organizations.
* Perkins developed a unique, three-dimensional theory of intelligence during this period.

#### Three Types of Intelligence

* **Neural Intelligence**

  * Refers to the genetically determined abilities of a person's neurological system.
  * Considered the "hard-wired, original equipment" of the brain—similar to computer hardware.
  * Largely fixed; not easily increased.
  * Measured by traditional IQ tests.

* **Experiential Intelligence**

  * Accumulated knowledge and skills gained through experience.
  * Expands as we encounter diverse contexts and challenges in life.
  * Comparable to the different programs that can run on computer hardware.
  * People in stimulating environments develop greater experiential intelligence.

* **Reflective Intelligence**

  * The ability to use and manage mental skills—employing thinking strategies for effective problem solving and self-monitoring.
  * Increases with self-awareness and intentional changes in thought patterns.
  * Like a computer’s operating system, it manages and optimizes how we use our neural and experiential intelligence.
  * Can be improved and "upgraded" over time.

#### Learnable Intelligence

* **Learnable Intelligence** is the combination of **experiential** and **reflective intelligence**.
* While **neural intelligence** is fixed, you can grow your learnable intelligence by:

  * Gaining more experiences (increasing experiential intelligence).
  * Developing better thinking strategies (enhancing reflective intelligence).
* Reflective intelligence is key: by managing and directing our experiences, we can learn to act and think more intelligently.
* Computer analogy:

  * Hardware = Neural intelligence (fixed)
  * Operating system = Reflective intelligence (upgradable)
  * Programs = Experiential intelligence (accumulated and applied)
  * Together, upgrades and new programs increase the computer’s usefulness—just as increasing experiential and reflective intelligence raises a person's learnable intelligence.

#### Summary

* **Perkins’ Theory of Learnable Intelligence** sees intelligence as three-dimensional: neural (hardware), experiential (programs), and reflective (operating system).
* **Neural intelligence** is innate and unchangeable.
* **Experiential and reflective intelligence** can be increased—together, they make up **learnable intelligence**.
* By focusing on experiences and strategies for thinking, anyone can raise their overall intelligence, even if their basic neural abilities remain the same.

### Section 9: What Is a Cognitive Function?

#### Definition and Purpose

* **Cognitive functions** are mental processes used to acquire and process information.
* Cognitive psychologists study these functions to understand **how we gather, store, use, and interpret information** in daily life.
* Everyday activities like listening, watching, reading, searching for information, or paying attention all involve cognitive functions.

#### Types of Cognitive Functions

* **Attention**

* **Memory**

* **Language**

* **Perception**

* **Decision making**

* **Problem solving**

* These functions often **work together**, allowing us to gather, interpret, and use information effectively.

#### Memory, Decision Making, and Problem Solving

* **Working memory** allows us to hold and manipulate information for tasks such as reasoning, discussion, or problem solving.

  * Example: During a debate about dinner choices, you must remember arguments, recall past experiences, and construct responses.
* Working memory consists of:

  * **Phonological loop** (verbal content)
  * **Visual-spatial sketchpad** (visual content)
  * **Central executive** (manages the system)

#### Attention, Language, and Perception

* **Attention** can be:

  * **Divided attention:** focusing on multiple things at once.
  * **Sustained attention:** concentrating on one thing over time.
* **Language** involves both speech expression and comprehension, and can **influence the way we think and perceive the world**.

  * Example: Cultures with different language structures may perceive colors or quantities differently.
* **Perception** interacts with attention and language—what we focus on and how we describe it can affect what we remember.

#### Cognitive Function Assessment

* We cannot directly observe cognitive functions in the brain, but we can **measure them through behavioral and neuroimaging methods**.

* **Traditional Assessments:**

  * Behavioral tasks such as reaction time, error rate, eye-tracking, free recall, and recognition tests are used to infer cognitive abilities.
  * Language assessments may involve speech production, comprehension, and how language impacts thought or interaction.

* **Neuroimaging Assessments:**

  * Modern techniques (like fMRI and PET scans) allow researchers to observe brain activity as participants perform cognitive tasks.
  * This approach has helped establish the field of **cognitive neuroscience**, connecting mental processes with brain activity.

#### Cognitive Function and Aging

* Cognitive function assessments are important for understanding how abilities change over a lifespan.
* **Attention and memory** are especially prone to age-related decline, impacting higher-level functions such as decision making.
* Perception and language can also decline with age, but attention and memory are most affected.

#### Summary

* **Cognitive functions** are mental processes for acquiring and using information: memory, attention, perception, language, problem solving, and decision making.
* Psychologists study these processes through both indirect (behavioral) and direct (neuroimaging) assessments.
* Understanding cognitive functions helps explain mental processes behind behavior and how these change with age.

### Section 10: What Is Intelligence?

#### Watson and Artificial Intelligence

* In 2011, IBM’s **Watson** defeated two Jeopardy! champions by processing human speech, searching vast databases, and responding in a human-like voice.
* Watson's technology is now applied in real-world settings, such as hospitals, where it helps diagnose diseases and recommend treatments—supporting, not replacing, human professionals.

#### Defining Artificial Intelligence

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to systems made up of people, hardware, software, data, and knowledge that together demonstrate **intelligent behavior**.
* Characteristics of intelligent behavior in AI include:

  * Learning from experience and applying new knowledge
  * Handling complex or uncertain situations
  * Solving problems with incomplete information
  * Determining what information is important
  * Reacting quickly and appropriately to new situations
  * Understanding visual images
  * Processing and manipulating symbols
  * Demonstrating creativity and imagination

#### Types of AI

* AI systems can replicate human decision making for well-defined problems.
* **Robotics:** Uses AI for precision, efficiency, or safety (e.g., factory assembly lines, space exploration).
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables computers to understand and respond to human language (e.g., voice assistants, automated phone systems).
* **Learning Systems:** Allow computers to adjust actions based on feedback (e.g., computer chess games that learn from mistakes).
* **Neural Networks:** Mimic brain-like processing; capable of recognizing patterns and learning from large sets of data.

#### Expert Systems

* **Expert systems** allow novices to perform at expert level in very specific domains.

* Composed of:

  * **Knowledge base:** Contains documented expertise and experience from human experts.
  * **Inference engine:** Searches for information and logical relationships to provide answers or suggestions, simulating expert reasoning.
  * **User interface:** Allows users to interact with the system, often through guided questions.

* Example: A bank’s loan approval expert system enables junior managers to analyze loan applications using the expertise of senior staff.

* **Expert system development** requires collaboration among:

  * **Domain experts:** Individuals whose expertise is captured.
  * **Knowledge engineers:** Specialists who design and build the system.
  * **Knowledge users:** People who use the system in practice.

#### Summary

* **Artificial intelligence (AI) systems** bring together people, technology, data, and expertise to create machines that exhibit intelligent behavior.
* AI encompasses a range of technologies that replicate human decision making for well-defined problems.
* **Expert systems** make expert-level decision-making accessible to novices by combining expert knowledge with inference and user-friendly interfaces.
