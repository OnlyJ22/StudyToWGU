### Section 4: Overview of Microsoft Access

**What Is Microsoft Access?**
Microsoft Access is a desktop database management system (DBMS) from Microsoft that integrates a graphical user interface with the Microsoft Jet Database Engine. It allows users to create, manage, and interact with relational databases using tables, forms, queries, and reports. Access is included in the Microsoft Office suite and is commonly used for small to medium-sized database applications.

**Key Features**

* User-friendly GUI for designing databases without programming skills.
* Can serve as both a **front-end** (for forms/reports) and **back-end** (data storage).
* Frequently used in combination with **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)** for automation and advanced logic.
* Supports interaction with external DBMSs (SQL Server, Oracle) and Microsoft Office apps (Excel, Outlook).

**Comparison with Other Databases**

* Uses its own file-based format (`.accdb`, `.mdb`).
* Useful for local, standalone applications or prototypes.
* Lacks scalability for high-concurrency enterprise scenarios like SQL Server or Oracle.
* Can link to other databases or act as a reporting tool.

**History Timeline**

* **1992**: Access 1.0 released (beta as "Cirrus").
* **1993–1999**: Incremental releases improved UI and integration (e.g., Access 2.0, 97, 2000).
* **2007**: `.accdb` format introduced, added SharePoint support.
* **2010**: Hosted solutions for SharePoint.

* **2016–2019**: Enhanced Linked Table Manager and further integration with Office 365.

**Jet Database Engine**

* Jet = **Joint Engine Technology**: retrieves and updates database records.
* Widely used in Access and Visual Basic.
* Superseded by the **ACE (Access Connectivity Engine)** in later versions.

**Access and SQL Server**

* SQL Server is designed for high-performance, multi-user environments.
* Used as a back-end for Access in more robust systems.
* Both support relational data models and SQL queries, but SQL Server provides enterprise-grade performance, security, and scalability.

**Lesson Summary**
Microsoft Access combines user-friendly GUI tools with a relational engine, ideal for desktop-level database applications. It serves as a practical tool for rapid application development and integration with other Microsoft products. However, for enterprise-scale data systems, SQL Server or Oracle are more suitable due to better concurrency, transaction handling, and performance.

### Section 5: What Is Markup Language?

**Definition:**
A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. It uses tags or symbols to define elements within the content, affecting how text appears or behaves in electronic formats. Common examples include **HTML**, **XML**, and **XHTML**.

**Analogy:**
Using all caps, bold, or underlining in handwritten notes is a real-world analogy to markup—it emphasizes or classifies content.

**Markup Tags Basics:**

* Tags are enclosed in **angle brackets**: `<tag>` and `</tag>`.
* They instruct browsers on **how to display content**.
* Example:

  ```html
  <p>This is a <b>bold</b> word.</p>
  ```

#### Timeline of Markup Language Evolution

| Version           | Year         | Key Features                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SGML**          | 1986         | First generalized markup language; government use      |
| **HTML 1.0**      | 1993         | First web-oriented markup derived from SGML            |
| **HTML 4.0/4.01** | 1997/1999    | Added support for style sheets, scripting              |
| **XHTML 1.0**     | 2000         | Enforced stricter syntax; XML-based                    |
| **HTML5**         | 2008 (Draft) | Introduced native support for video, audio, and canvas |

* HTML 4.01 featured support of three new HTML development stages: transitional, strict, and frameset, each stage offering various capabilities and structure options.
---

#### HTML5 Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Video Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <video controls src="movie.mp4">
    Your browser does not support the HTML5 video tag.
  </video>
</body>
</html>
```

#### The Browser Wars

* **1990s:** HTML evolution led to competing browser capabilities.
* **Netscape Navigator vs. Internet Explorer**: Limited compatibility forced developers to favor one browser.
* **2000s onward:** **Firefox**, **Chrome**, **Safari**, and **Opera** emerged with better standards compliance.

**Lesson Summary:**
Markup languages use tags to define the structure and presentation of electronic documents. They evolved from SGML to HTML5, becoming essential to web development. Browser competition spurred the adoption of newer markup capabilities, leading to modern, dynamic, and cross-platform web experiences.

### Section 6: Introduction to XML

**Definition:**
**XML (Extensible Markup Language)** is a markup language designed to store and transport data. Unlike HTML, which focuses on displaying content, XML emphasizes the structure and meaning of data. XML allows developers to define custom tags to describe data elements clearly and consistently.

---

**Example XML Document:**

```xml
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<icecream>
  <flavor>Vanilla</flavor>
  <topping>Chocolate</topping>
  <numberOfscoops>2</numberOfscoops>
  <price>$3.99</price>
</icecream>
```

Each tag (e.g., `<flavor>`) defines an **element** that stores a specific piece of data.

---

**Uses of XML:**

* Integrates with HTML to display data on web pages.
* Stores form data submitted online.
* Facilitates data sharing between different systems.
* Used in configuration files and business applications.

**Typical Technologies Involved:**

* **JavaScript**: For reading and writing XML data.
* **HTML**: Hosts XML or displays data fetched from XML.
* **.xml** and **.xsd** files: Store the data and schema templates, respectively.

---

**XML Schema (XSD):**
An **XML Schema Definition (XSD)** is a blueprint for an XML document. It specifies:

* **Element names**
* **Data types** (e.g., `xs:string`, `xs:decimal`, `xs:time`)
* **Sequence** of data entries

**Example XML Schema:**

```xml
<xs:sequence>
  <xs:element name='flavor' type='xs:string'/>
  <xs:element name='topping' type='xs:string'/>
  <xs:element name='numberOfscoops' type='xs:positiveInteger'/>
  <xs:element name='price' type='xs:decimal'/>
  <xs:element name='pickUptime' type='xs:time'/>
</xs:sequence>
```

This schema ensures data consistency and correct formatting in XML files.

---

**Lesson Summary:**
XML is a flexible language used for storing and transporting data. It separates data from presentation and is commonly used in web technologies. The **XML schema (.xsd)** defines the structure and type of data each XML file should contain, helping to enforce uniformity and data integrity across applications.

### Section 7: Introduction to JSON

**Definition:**
**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight, human-readable data format used for representing structured and hierarchical data. It originated from JavaScript but is supported by virtually all modern programming languages.

---

**Data Types in JSON**

* **Number:** Integer or floating-point (e.g., `9`, `0.2`)
* **String:** UTF‑8 text (supports emojis, symbols)
* **Boolean:** `true` or `false`
* **null:** Represents absence of value
* **Object:** Key-value pairs enclosed in `{}`; keys are strings
* **Array:** Ordered list of values enclosed in `[]`

**Example:**

```json
{
  "parents": [
    {"name": "Frank Smith", "role": "father"},
    {"name": "Jane Smith", "role": "mother"}
  ],
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "Joe Smith",
      "attends_school": true,
      "age": 9,
      "favorite_color": "blue"
    },
    {
      "name": "Anna Smith",
      "attends_school": false,
      "age": 0.2,
      "favorite_color": null
    }
  ]
}
```

---

**Advantages of JSON**

* Less verbose than XML
* Easy to read and write
* Natively supported in web environments and APIs
* Lightweight format for data interchange

---

**Validation and Schema Support**

JSON syntax doesn’t include native schema enforcement or comments. Validation and structure rules can be applied using external tools such as **JSON Schema**.

---

**JSON in Databases**

* **SQL Databases:**

  * Can store JSON in text columns or in JSON-specific data types (e.g., PostgreSQL’s `JSONB`).
  * Querying JSON within SQL adds complexity and may impact performance.

* **NoSQL Databases:**

  * Use flexible, schema-less storage (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB).
  * JSON (or BSON) is stored natively and efficiently.
  * No built-in referential integrity—applications must manage relationships.

---

**When to Use JSON**

* Exchanging data between web services (APIs)
* Configuration files
* Hierarchical or evolving data structures
* NoSQL systems or SQL systems with native JSON support

---

**Lesson Summary**

JSON is a simple, language-agnostic format ideal for data interchange. It excels when flexibility is needed and schema requirements are variable. JSON integrates well with both SQL and NoSQL databases but offers the most seamless experience in NoSQL environments.
