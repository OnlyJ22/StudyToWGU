### üß† Section 1: Structured Query Language (SQL)

#### üóÉÔ∏è What Is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a specialized programming language used to **interact with relational databases**. It allows you to:

* Retrieve specific information (queries)
* Insert new records
* Update or delete existing records
* Create or modify database structures (tables, users, etc.)

SQL is widely supported and standardized by ANSI, making it a skill that's transferable across different DBMS platforms like **MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle**.

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è Basic SQL Functionality

SQL enables **data manipulation**, which includes:

* Adding new data
* Changing existing data
* Retrieving targeted data based on conditions (queries)

**Example Scenario:**
In a company‚Äôs employee database, you might want to find employees hired in the past year or earning above a certain salary. SQL makes this easy.

---

#### üßæ SQL Statements

Some of the most common SQL statements include:

* `SELECT`: Retrieves data
* `INSERT INTO`: Adds new records
* `UPDATE`: Modifies existing records
* `DELETE`: Removes records
* `CREATE`: Builds new tables or databases

---

#### üîç SQL SELECT Statement ‚Äî Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT field1, field2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**

To find names of employees earning more than \$65,000:

```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 65000;
```

To get all fields:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 65000
ORDER BY Name;
```

---

#### ‚ûï SQL Operators

**Arithmetic Operators:**

* `+` (Add)
* `-` (Subtract)
* `*` (Multiply)
* `/` (Divide)

**Comparison Operators:**

* `=` (Equal to)
* `<>` (Not equal to)
* `>` (Greater than)
* `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
* `<` (Less than)
* `<=` (Less than or equal to)

---

#### üîó Boolean Logic in SQL

**Logical Operators:**

* `AND`: True only if both conditions are true
* `OR`: True if at least one condition is true
* `NOT`: True if the condition is false

**Examples:**

```sql
WHERE Salary > 65000 AND Position = 'Accountant';
-- Finds Accountants earning over $65,000
```

```sql
WHERE Position = 'Accountant' OR Position = 'Financial Analyst';
-- Lists both Accountants and Financial Analysts
```

```sql
WHERE NOT (Position = 'Accountant');
-- Shows all employees except Accountants
```

### üß† Section 2: Basic SQL Commands in DBMS

#### üîç Understanding DBMS & SQL

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that lets users access, manage, and manipulate databases.
**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard language used to perform queries, updates, and other operations on databases.

Think of it like ordering pizza:

1. **Logging in to the DBMS** = calling the pizza shop
2. **Writing an SQL query** = placing your order
3. **Getting query results** = receiving your pizza

---

#### üîç `SELECT` Statement

Used to **retrieve data** from one or more tables.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column;
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT last_name, hire_date
FROM employee
WHERE hire_date <= '2001-12-01'
AND department_number = 09
ORDER BY hire_date;
```

**Result:**

| last\_name | hire\_date |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Miller     | 2001-05-29 |
| Williams   | 2001-11-27 |

**Using LIKE clause:**

```sql
WHERE first_name LIKE 'M%';
```

Returns all records where the first name starts with the letter M.

---

#### üîó `JOIN` Statements

Used to **combine data from two tables** based on related columns.

**INNER JOIN Example:**

```sql
SELECT last_name, id, department_name
FROM employee
INNER JOIN department
ON employee.department_number = department.department_number
WHERE department.department_number = 10;
```

**Result:**

| last\_name | id  | department\_name |
| ---------- | --- | ---------------- |
| Jones      | 213 | Shipping         |
| Smith      | 205 | Shipping         |

**Other types:**

* `LEFT JOIN`: Includes all rows from the left table
* `RIGHT JOIN`: Includes all rows from the right table

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è Other Essential SQL Commands

---

##### üß± `CREATE`

Creates a new table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE location (
  location_name VARCHAR,
  location_id NUMBER,
  department_number NUMBER
);
```

---

##### ‚ûï `INSERT`

Adds new data to a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO employee (last_name, first_name, hire_date, department_number, id)
VALUES ('Johnson', 'Kim', '2002-01-01', 11, 200);
```

---

##### ‚úèÔ∏è `UPDATE`

Modifies existing data:

```sql
UPDATE employee
SET hire_date = '2003-01-01'
WHERE id = 200;
```

---

##### ‚ùå `DELETE`

Removes specific records:

```sql
DELETE FROM department
WHERE department_number = 11;
```

---

##### üßπ `TRUNCATE`

Deletes **all rows** from a table (cannot be rolled back):

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE employee;
```

---

##### üí• `DROP`

Completely removes a table from the database:

```sql
DROP TABLE employee;
```

---

#### üìö Lesson Summary

* ‚úÖ A **DBMS** helps manage databases, and **SQL** is the language to interact with them.
* ‚úÖ `SELECT` retrieves data using optional filters like `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIKE`.
* ‚úÖ `JOIN` merges related data from multiple tables.
* ‚úÖ Commands like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DROP`, and `CREATE` provide full control over data and database structure.

### üß† Section 3: Creating & Deleting Databases in SQL

#### üß± Creating a Database

Before you can store or query data, you need to create a database using the `CREATE DATABASE` command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdbname;
```

* `testdbname` is your chosen name.
* It‚Äôs best practice to use **all lowercase** names.
* Some SQL variants are **case-sensitive**, so lowercase avoids issues.

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è CREATE DATABASE in Transact-SQL (T-SQL)

```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdbname
(
  NAME = testdbname,
  FILENAME = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL11.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\testdbname.mdf',
  SIZE = 10,
  MAXSIZE = 50,
  FILEGROWTH = 5
);
```

**Explanation of options:**

* `NAME`: Logical name of the database
* `FILENAME`: Path to the primary data file (`.mdf`)
* `SIZE`: Initial size in MB
* `MAXSIZE`: Maximum size (or `UNLIMITED`)
* `FILEGROWTH`: Amount the file will grow each time expansion is needed

---

#### üê¨ CREATE DATABASE in MySQL

```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdbname
CHARACTER SET utf8
COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
```

* `CHARACTER SET`: Defines the character encoding (e.g., `utf8`)
* `COLLATE`: Defines how string comparisons are handled

üìù In MySQL, you can also use:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA testdbname;
```

üí° *Schemas* are essentially containers of related database objects like tables and procedures.

---

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Summary of CREATE Options

* You don‚Äôt need to include all options ‚Äî defaults will be applied.
* Both T-SQL and MySQL offer extensions, but a simple `CREATE DATABASE name;` will still work.
* Use options to customize **size**, **growth**, **encoding**, and more when needed.

---

#### ‚ùå Deleting a Database

To remove a database completely, use the `DROP DATABASE` command:

```sql
DROP DATABASE testdbname;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This deletes the **entire database and all its data** permanently.

---

#### üß© DROP DATABASE in T-SQL

In T-SQL, you should switch to the `master` database first:

```sql
USE master;
DROP DATABASE testdbname;
```

---

#### üß™ DROP DATABASE in MySQL

To safely drop a database **only if it exists**, use:

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS testdbname;
```

‚úÖ You can also write:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS testdbname;
```

---

#### üìö Lesson Summary

* `CREATE DATABASE` is used to make a new database for storing data.

  * Options (like `CHARSET`, `FILENAME`, `MAXSIZE`, etc.) vary by SQL flavor.
  * You can create a database with **just the name**, or add custom config.
* `DROP DATABASE` deletes the database and **everything inside it**.

  * In T-SQL, run `USE master` first.
  * In MySQL, use `IF EXISTS` for safety.

> üîí Always double-check before using `DROP DATABASE` ‚Äî it‚Äôs irreversible.

### üß† Section 4: SQL DDL Commands ‚Äî CREATE, ALTER & DROP

#### üß† What is DDL?

**Data Definition Language (DDL)** is a subset of SQL used to define and modify the **structure** of database objects like tables. It includes:

* `CREATE` ‚Äî to create new tables
* `ALTER` ‚Äî to modify existing table structures
* `DROP` ‚Äî to delete tables or other objects

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è The `CREATE` Command

Used to **create a new table** structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  column_1 data_type,
  column_2 data_type,
  ...
);
```

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Artist (
  artistID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  artistName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  genre VARCHAR(50),
  countryCode VARCHAR(5),
  notes VARCHAR(150)
);
```

---

#### üí£ The `DROP` Command

Used to **delete a table and all its data**:

```sql
DROP TABLE Table_Name;
```

**Example:**

```sql
DROP TABLE Artist;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This action is permanent ‚Äî use with caution.

---

#### üîß The `ALTER` Command

Used to **modify** an existing table‚Äôs structure.

---

##### ‚ûï Add Column(s)

```sql
ALTER TABLE Artist
ADD (
  subGenre VARCHAR(50),
  stateProvince VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

##### ‚úèÔ∏è Modify Column(s)

```sql
ALTER TABLE Artist
MODIFY artistName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE Artist
MODIFY genre VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL;
```

---

##### ‚ùå Drop Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE Artist
DROP COLUMN subGenre;
```

---

##### üè∑Ô∏è Rename Column or Table

**Rename a column:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE Artist
RENAME COLUMN countryCode TO ISOCountryCode;
```

**Rename the table:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE Artist
RENAME TO coolArtists;
```

---

#### üìö Lesson Summary

* `CREATE`: Build new tables with defined structure
* `ALTER`: Add, change, drop, or rename columns and tables
* `DROP`: Remove tables and their data completely
* DDL defines structure ‚Äî not data values themselves

### üß† Section 5: SQL DML Commands ‚Äî SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE & DELETE

#### ‚úÖ What is DML?

**Data Manipulation Language (DML)** refers to a set of SQL commands used to **modify data** within existing database structures ‚Äî but **not** to alter the structure itself. DML includes:

* `SELECT` ‚Äì retrieve data
* `INSERT` ‚Äì add new data
* `UPDATE` ‚Äì modify existing data
* `DELETE` ‚Äì remove data

---

#### üîç `SELECT` Command

Used to **query and retrieve** data from one or more tables.

```sql
SELECT artistName, genre, country
FROM tblArtist
WHERE country = 'Canada';
```

* `WHERE` filters results to specific conditions.
* Always end with a `;` in many SQL environments to execute properly.

---

#### ‚ûï `INSERT` Command

Used to **add a new row** of data into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO tblArtist (artistName, genre, country)
VALUES ('Boston', 'Rock', 'US');
```

* The order of columns must match the order of values.
* Data types must match the column definitions.

---

#### ‚úèÔ∏è `UPDATE` Command

Used to **modify existing data** in one or more rows.

```sql
UPDATE tblArtist
SET country = 'Canada'
WHERE artistName = 'Rush';
```

* Be sure to use `WHERE` to avoid updating all rows unintentionally.

---

#### ‚ùå `DELETE` Command

Used to **remove data** from a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM tblArtist
WHERE genre = 'Heavy Metal Disco';
```

* Use `WHERE` to delete specific rows.
* Can include a `SELECT` subquery for advanced deletions.

### üß† Section 6: SQL `INSERT` Statement

#### ‚úÖ What is the `INSERT` Command?

The `INSERT` statement in SQL is used to **add new data (records)** into an existing database table. It belongs to the **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** category, since it modifies data, not structure.

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
INSERT INTO table (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

* Column names and values **must match in order and data type**.
* String values go in quotes; numbers do not.
* Omitting a required field will trigger an error.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Tip:

Fields like **auto-incremented primary keys** do not need to be (and shouldn‚Äôt be) included in the `INSERT` statement.

---

#### üì• Inserting a Single Record

```sql
INSERT INTO tblAlbum (artistName, albumTitle, genre)
VALUES ('Journey', 'Raised on Radio', 'Rock');
```

**Resulting Table:**

| artistName | albumTitle      | genre |
| ---------- | --------------- | ----- |
| Journey    | Raised on Radio | Rock  |

---

#### üì• Inserting Without All Columns

If some fields are **optional (nullable)**, you can omit them:

```sql
INSERT INTO tblAlbum (artistName, albumTitle)
VALUES ('Meat Loaf', 'Bat out of Hell');
```

**Resulting Table:**

| artistName | albumTitle      | genre |
| ---------- | --------------- | ----- |
| Journey    | Raised on Radio | Rock  |
| Meat Loaf  | Bat out of Hell | NULL  |

---

#### üì¶ Inserting Multiple Records (from Another Table)

```sql
INSERT INTO tblBackup (artist, albumTitle, genre)
SELECT artist, albumTitle, genre
FROM customer
WHERE tblBackup.customerID = customer.customerID;
```

* Copies matching records from one table (`customer`) to another (`tblBackup`).
* Useful for **backups or audit logs**.


### üß† Section 7: SQL `UPDATE` Statement

#### ‚úÖ What is the `UPDATE` Command?

The `UPDATE` statement in SQL is used to **modify existing records** in a database table. It belongs to the **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** category, allowing changes to data based on specified conditions.

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
UPDATE table
SET column1 = expression,
    column2 = expression2
[WHERE condition];
````

* `SET` assigns new values to one or more columns.
* `WHERE` is **optional**, but omitting it updates **all rows**.
* Use `WHERE` to prevent unintentional mass updates.

---

#### üîÅ Subquery Syntax

```sql
UPDATE table1
SET column1 = (
    SELECT expression
    FROM table2
    WHERE condition
)
[WHERE condition];
```

* Updates values in `table1` using data from `table2`.
* Subquery must return a **single value** per affected row.

---

#### üì• Example: Simple Update

**Original `Flights` Table:**

| Departing\_Airport | Arriving\_Airport | Flight\_Number | Depart\_Time | AM/PM |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| ORD                | LAX               | 145            | 7:45         | AM    |
| ORD                | LAX               | 699            | 9:00         | PM    |
| LAX                | ATL               | 725            | 10:00        | PM    |
| ORD                | ATL               | 525            | 10:30        | PM    |

```sql
UPDATE Flights
SET Depart_Time = '10:00'
WHERE Flight_Number = 699;
```

**Updated Table:**

| Departing\_Airport | Arriving\_Airport | Flight\_Number | Depart\_Time | AM/PM |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| ORD                | LAX               | 145            | 7:45         | AM    |
| ORD                | LAX               | 699            | 10:00        | PM    |
| LAX                | ATL               | 725            | 10:00        | PM    |
| ORD                | ATL               | 525            | 10:30        | PM    |

---

#### üì¶ Example: Update Using Subquery

**Airport\_Names Table:**

| Name        | Abbreviation |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Los Angeles | LAX          |
| O'Hare      | ORD          |
| Atlanta     | ATL          |

```sql
UPDATE Flights
SET Arriving_Airport = (
    SELECT Name
    FROM Airport_Names
    WHERE Abbreviation = 'ATL'
)
WHERE Flight_Number = 725;
```

**Updated `Flights` Table:**

| Departing\_Airport | Arriving\_Airport | Flight\_Number | Depart\_Time | AM/PM |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| ORD                | LAX               | 145            | 7:45         | AM    |
| ORD                | LAX               | 699            | 9:00         | PM    |
| LAX                | Atlanta           | 725            | 10:00        | PM    |
| ORD                | ATL               | 525            | 10:30        | PM    |


### üß† Section 8: SQL `DROP` vs `DELETE`

#### ‚úÖ What Do `DROP` and `DELETE` Do?

* `DROP` **permanently removes** entire tables, columns, or views ‚Äî including their structure and associated data.
* `DELETE` **removes specific rows (records)** from a table, but **preserves the table structure**.

---

#### ü™ì `DROP` Command: Syntax & Usage

**Drop an Entire Table/View:**

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
DROP VIEW view_name;
````

> üíÄ **Irreversible** ‚Äî Deletes the structure and all data.

---

#### üß± Drop a Column (Uses `ALTER TABLE`)

```sql
-- SQL Server / Oracle
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;

-- MySQL
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP column_name;
```

* **Deletes the column and its data permanently**
* Cannot drop a column that is a **primary key** or **foreign key** without removing dependencies first.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Remove SSN column from customer_data
ALTER TABLE customer_data DROP COLUMN SSN;
-- MySQL version
ALTER TABLE customer_data DROP SSN;
```

---

#### ‚ùå Tip: `DROP COLUMN` ‚â† `DELETE`

* `DROP COLUMN` destroys the **data field**.
* `DELETE` removes **data records (rows)** only.

---

#### üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Delete Rows with `DELETE`

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

* Requires `WHERE` to avoid deleting **all rows**.
* Deletes only **specific records**.
* **Can be rolled back** (if ROLLBACK is enabled in the DB session).

**Example:**

```sql
DELETE FROM Customer_Table_2
WHERE firstName = 'John' AND lastName = 'Doe';
```

* Removes **both John Doe records**.
* Add more conditions (e.g., postal code) to be more specific.

---

#### üí• Caution

* Omitting `WHERE` in `DELETE` will remove **all rows**:

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM table_name;  -- Danger: wipes out table data
  ```

* `DELETE` cannot remove rows that violate **foreign key constraints**.

* `DROP` operations are **irreversible** and will **destroy schema elements**.


### üß† Section 9: SQL `DROP INDEX` and `DROP DATABASE`

#### ‚úÖ What is SQL?

**Structured Query Language (SQL)** is a **command-oriented language** used to interact with relational databases ‚Äî for tasks such as storing, searching, retrieving, and modifying data. Originally developed by IBM in the 1970s and commercialized by Oracle in 1979, SQL has become the industry standard.

---

#### üóÉÔ∏è What is a Database?

A **database** is a structured collection of related data. It may store:

* Contacts in your phone
* Emails on your computer
* Credit card transaction records

---

#### üî¢ What is an Index?

An **index** is a sequence of values that creates a logical ordering of rows in a table without changing their physical layout.

* Allows fast searching, sorting, and filtering.
* E.g., a **last name index** helps sort records alphabetically without physically rearranging them.

---

#### üóëÔ∏è What Do `DROP INDEX` and `DROP DATABASE` Do?

| Command        | Effect                                 | Syntax                                |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `DROP INDEX`   | Removes an index, not the data         | `DROP INDEX <table>.<index_name>;`     |
| `DROP DATABASE`| Removes the entire database and data   | `DROP DATABASE <database_name>;`       |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Both commands are **destructive** and **permanent** ‚Äî use with caution.

---

#### üß± Example: Drop an Index

```sql
DROP INDEX tblAlbum.dateModified;
````

* Removes the `dateModified` index from `tblAlbum`.
* Reclaims the index's storage space.
* **Does not delete table data**.

---

#### üí£ Example: Drop a Database

```sql
DROP DATABASE albumsBackup;
```

* Deletes the **entire `albumsBackup` database**, including all its tables and data.
