### Section 1: Logical Fallacies

#### ***What Are Logical Fallacies?***

**Logical fallacies** are flawed methods of reasoning that may seem convincing but are **not based on sound evidence or logic**. They occur when conclusions are drawn without proper reasoning, which leads to **unreliable or misleading arguments**.
*Example*: Claiming a monster exists just because someone said they saw it lacks verifiable proof—this is **bad logic**.

*Important note*: A fallacy doesn't always mean the conclusion is false—just that the reasoning is **not logically valid**. Even flawed logic can sometimes lead to **accidentally true** results.

#### ***Types of Logical Fallacies***

**Hasty Generalization**

* *Definition*: Making assumptions about a group based on a small or unrepresentative sample.
* *Example*: Assuming all babies talk by 8 months because one baby did so.

  * This ignores variability and lacks enough evidence to support the claim.

**Circular Reasoning**

* *Definition*: Using a statement to prove itself without providing independent support.
* *Example*: Saying stars are painted in the sky because they are painted in the sky.

  * This creates a logic loop with no real proof—often seen in phrases like `"Because I said so."`

**False Cause**

* *Definition*: Assuming a causal relationship between two events simply because they happen together or in sequence.
* *Example*: Believing you can open automatic doors by swinging your arms because the doors open when you do.

  * This wrongly attributes *cause* to *coincidence*.

**Limited Choice**

* *Definition*: Presenting only a few options when more valid options exist.
* *Example*: A survey asking your favorite color but offering only red, blue, and yellow.

  * This *excludes other real possibilities*, leading to an incomplete or biased conclusion.

#### **Lesson Summary**

We explored **four common logical fallacies**—forms of poor reasoning that can lead to incorrect or unsupported conclusions:

* *Hasty Generalization*: Drawing conclusions from limited evidence.
* *Circular Reasoning*: Using the conclusion as the premise.
* *False Cause*: Linking unrelated events as cause and effect.
* *Limited Choice*: Reducing options when more exist.

While conclusions formed from fallacies *can* be true, the reasoning is **unreliable and misleading**, and should not be used to support sound arguments.

### Section 2: Appeal to Ignorance Fallacy

#### ***What Are Logical Fallacies?***

Logical fallacies are **errors in reasoning** that occur when arguments are not based on pure facts or sound logic. These are not just incorrect conclusions—they’re conclusions **drawn from flawed reasoning**.
*Example*: Saying corn starch is sugar because a group of people acts like it is—this isn't sound logic, even if the result *feels* true.

Logical fallacies can sometimes lead to **correct conclusions**, but their **reasoning process is unreliable**, especially in disciplines like math, where proofs and theorems require precise logic.

#### ***Appeal to Ignorance***

* *Definition*: Asserting something is true just because it hasn’t been proven false (or vice versa).
* *Example*: Saying giant squids don’t exist because you’ve never seen one.

  * This fails to consider **missing or incomplete information**.

*In Math*: A child claiming 2 + 4 = 24 because "+" looks like putting numbers together visually. The child lacks knowledge, which leads to flawed reasoning.
Even mathematicians must avoid assuming something is true **just because a counterexample isn’t immediately obvious**.

#### ***Appeal to Emotion***

* *Definition*: Using feelings instead of facts to persuade someone that something is true.
* *Example*: A shoe commercial makes you feel sporty and popular, so you believe the shoes will transform your life.

  * But that emotional link **isn’t proof**.

*In Math*: Feeling emotionally attached to an answer doesn’t make it right.
You can't argue, “It just feels correct,” without actual **proof or calculations** to support it.

#### ***Appeal to Popularity***

* *Definition*: Claiming something is true because it's widely believed to be true.
* *Example*: Everyone says 2 + 2 = 5—does that make it true?

  * No—**popular belief is not always logical** or factual.

*In Math*: Just because a group of students all got the same answer doesn’t mean it’s correct.
Mathematical truth requires **individual verification and evidence**, not consensus.

#### **Lesson Summary**

We explored three **types of logical fallacies**:

* *Appeal to Ignorance*: Assuming something is true due to lack of contrary evidence.
* *Appeal to Emotion*: Believing something based on how it makes you feel.
* *Appeal to Popularity*: Accepting something as true because many people believe it.

All of these are **unsound arguments** and should be avoided in logical reasoning, especially in mathematics.
*Correct math relies on fact-based, provable logic—not assumptions, emotions, or popularity.*

### Section 3: Propositions and Logical Connectives

#### ***What Is a Proposition?***

A **proposition** is a statement that can be **clearly identified as either true or false**.
*Examples*:

* Maria has a blue dog.
* Kevin has a purple cat.
* Joann has a black rat.

These are not questions or commands—they are statements with definite **truth values**.

---

#### ***Negation***

**Negation** is the process of flipping the truth of a proposition.

* Add **NOT** to change a **positive** statement to a **negative**:

  * *Maria has a blue dog* → *Maria does **not** have a blue dog*
* Remove **NOT** to change a **negative** to a **positive**:

  * *We are not in the year 1990* → *We are in the year 1990*

This process **reverses the truth value** of the statement.

##### *Truth Table for Negation*:

| `p` | `NOT p` |
| --- | ------- |
| T   | F       |
| F   | T       |

---

#### ***Truth Tables and Compound Propositions***

A **truth table** helps analyze combinations of truth values between multiple propositions.

##### *Basic Two-Proposition Table (`p` and `q`)*:

| `p` | `q` |
| --- | --- |
| T   | T   |
| T   | F   |
| F   | T   |
| F   | F   |

---

#### **1. `p AND q` (Conjunction)**

* True only if **both** `p` and `q` are true.
* *Example*: “The room is blue **and** the lamp is blue”

| `p` | `q` | `p AND q` |
| --- | --- | --------- |
| T   | T   | T         |
| T   | F   | F         |
| F   | T   | F         |
| F   | F   | F         |

---

#### **2. `p OR q` (Disjunction)**

* True if **at least one** of `p` or `q` is true.
* *Example*: “The cat is chasing the mouse **or** the dog is chasing the cat”

| `p` | `q` | `p OR q` |
| --- | --- | -------- |
| T   | T   | T        |
| T   | F   | T        |
| F   | T   | T        |
| F   | F   | F        |

---

#### **3. `If p, then q` (Conditional)**

* False **only** when `p` is true and `q` is false.
* Think of it as a **promise**: if `p` happens, then `q` must follow.

| `p` | `q` | `If p, then q` |
| --- | --- | -------------- |
| T   | T   | T              |
| T   | F   | F              |
| F   | T   | T              |
| F   | F   | T              |

---

#### **4. `p if and only if q` (Biconditional)**

* True only when `p` and `q` share the **same** truth value.

| `p` | `q` | `p if and only if q` |
| --- | --- | -------------------- |
| T   | T   | T                    |
| T   | F   | F                    |
| F   | T   | F                    |
| F   | F   | T                    |

---

#### **Full Truth Table Example**

| `p` | `q` | `p AND q` | `p OR q` | `If p, then q` | `p iff q` |
| --- | --- | --------- | -------- | -------------- | --------- |
| T   | T   | T         | T        | T              | T         |
| T   | F   | F         | T        | F              | F         |
| F   | T   | F         | T        | T              | F         |
| F   | F   | F         | F        | T              | T         |

---

#### **More Complex Tables**

With three propositions (`p`, `q`, `r`), the number of scenarios doubles:

* `2³ = 8` possible combinations

| `p` | `q` | `r` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T   | T   | T   |
| T   | T   | F   |
| T   | F   | T   |
| T   | F   | F   |
| F   | T   | T   |
| F   | T   | F   |
| F   | F   | T   |
| F   | F   | F   |

You can extend the table with more columns to include combinations like:

* `(p AND q) OR r`
* `If (p OR r), then q`

---

#### **Lesson Summary**

* **Propositions** are statements that can be labeled as true or false.
* **Negations** flip the truth value of a proposition.
* **Truth tables** help visualize logic relationships between multiple propositions.
* Key **logic combinations**:

  * `AND`: Both must be true.
  * `OR`: At least one must be true.
  * `If p, then q`: Only false when `p` is true and `q` is false.
  * `p if and only if q`: True when both are either true or both false.

Understanding truth tables and logical combinations is **fundamental to reasoning, math, and computer science**.
You're right — I appreciate the correction.

### Section 4: Statements, Conjunctions, and Disjunctions in Logic

#### **What Is a Statement?**

A **statement** is any sentence that can clearly be labeled as **true** or **false**.

*Examples:*

* "A triangle has three sides." – True
* "Sue has a Great Dane." – May be true or false

Statements can be about anything, not just math.

#### **Connectors: Combining Two Statements**

To form a **compound statement**, two basic logical connectors are used:

* **AND** – Called a *conjunction*
* **OR** – Called a *disjunction*

Each affects the truth value of the combined statement differently.

#### **Conjunction (AND)**

*Only when both statements are true is the compound statement true.*

*Truth Table:*

```
p     q     p AND q
T     T        T
T     F        F
F     T        F
F     F        F
```

*Examples:*

* "Squares are rectangles" and "Circles are ovals" → False (since only one is true)
* "John likes chocolate ice cream" and "Sue likes strawberry ice cream" → True (if both are true)

#### **Disjunction (OR)**

*If at least one of the statements is true, the compound statement is true.*

*Truth Table:*

```
p     q     p OR q
T     T       T
T     F       T
F     T       T
F     F       F
```

*Examples:*

* "Squares are rectangles" or "Circles are ovals" → True (one is true)
* "John likes chocolate ice cream" or "Sue likes strawberry ice cream" → True (if either is true)

#### **Lesson Summary**

* A **statement** is any phrase that can be evaluated as true or false.
* A **conjunction** (AND) is only true when both component statements are true.
* A **disjunction** (OR) is true when at least one of the component statements is true.

### Section 5: Conditional Statements

#### **What Are Conditional Statements?**

A **conditional statement** expresses a logical relationship between two events or conditions using an **if-then** format. These statements reflect cause-and-effect logic, such as:

* “If I run the 100-meter dash in under 10 seconds, then I will break a school record.”

Even if this sounds unrealistic, the structure itself is logically valid and forms a conditional relationship.

#### **Structure of Conditional Statements**

Conditional statements are typically written in one of two formats:

* **If *hypothesis*, then *conclusion***
* ***Conclusion* is true if *hypothesis* is true**

Both express the same logical implication.

*Examples:*

* “If Carlos walks to work instead of driving, then his gas money cost will decrease.”
* “If Sam lives in Baltimore, then he lives in Maryland.”
* “A number will end in five or zero if it is divisible by five.”

#### **The Hypothesis**

The **hypothesis** is the **“if” part** of the statement — the condition that must occur first.

*Examples:*

* “If Carlos walks to work instead of driving, then his gas money cost will decrease.”
  *Hypothesis:* Carlos walks to work instead of driving.
* “If Sam lives in Baltimore, then he lives in Maryland.”
  *Hypothesis:* Sam lives in Baltimore.
* “A number will end in five or zero if it is divisible by five.”
  *Hypothesis:* It is divisible by five.

Even when the hypothesis follows the conclusion (as in the third example), it is still the **cause** in the logical structure.

#### **The Conclusion**

The **conclusion** is the **“then” part** of the statement — the outcome that logically follows the hypothesis.

*Examples:*

* “If Carlos walks to work instead of driving, then his gas money cost will decrease.”
  *Conclusion:* His gas money cost will decrease.
* “If Sam lives in Baltimore, then he lives in Maryland.”
  *Conclusion:* He lives in Maryland.
* “A number will end in five or zero if it is divisible by five.”
  *Conclusion:* A number will end in five or zero.

Even when “then” is not explicitly used, the **logical consequence** still defines the conclusion.

#### **Logic vs. Reality**

In formal logic, **truth values** are based solely on structure, not on real-world accuracy.

*Example:*

* “If Sue is pregnant, then her mom will give birth within the year.”
  Even though this doesn’t make real-world sense, in logic, we treat the statement’s truth value based on given assumptions.

You must **suspend real-world judgment** and evaluate conditional statements by their structure and designated truth values.

#### **Lesson Summary**

* A **conditional statement** links two ideas: “If *hypothesis*, then *conclusion*.”
* The **hypothesis** follows “if” and represents the condition.
* The **conclusion** follows “then” and represents the outcome.
* Even if statements are unrealistic, in logic, they are treated according to their **logical structure**, not real-life feasibility.

### Section 6: Logical Equivalence

#### **What Is Logical Equivalence?**

**Logical equivalence** occurs when two statements always share the same **truth value** — if one is true, so is the other; if one is false, the other must be false. These statements express the same logical meaning, even if they’re worded differently.

For example:

* **Conditional**: “If I am sitting on my floor, then I am at home.”
* **Contrapositive**: “If I am not at home, then I am not sitting on my floor.”

These two statements are **logically equivalent** because they carry the same truth under all circumstances.

---

#### Forms of Logical Statements

#### **1. Conditional Statement**

A **conditional** follows the structure:

> **If *p*, then *q***

Example:

> *If I am sitting on my floor, then I am at home.*

* **p (hypothesis)**: I am sitting on my floor
* **q (conclusion)**: I am at home

---

#### **2. Converse**

The **converse** switches the hypothesis and conclusion:

> **If *q*, then *p***

Example:

> *If I am at home, then I am sitting on my floor.*

* **Not logically equivalent** to the original conditional.
* This may be false even if the original is true (you can be at home and not on the floor).

---

#### **3. Inverse**

The **inverse** negates both the hypothesis and the conclusion:

> **If not *p*, then not *q***

Example:

> *If I am not sitting on my floor, then I am not at home.*

* **Not logically equivalent** to the original conditional.
* It may also be false even if the original is true.

---

#### **4. Contrapositive**

The **contrapositive** both **negates** and **reverses** the hypothesis and conclusion:

> **If not *q*, then not *p***

Example:

> *If I am not at home, then I am not sitting on my floor.*

* **Logically equivalent** to the original conditional.
* If the conditional is true, the contrapositive must also be true (and vice versa).

---

#### Logical Equivalence Summary Table

| Form           | Statement                | Equivalent to  |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| Conditional    | If *p*, then *q*         | Contrapositive |
| Converse       | If *q*, then *p*         | Inverse        |
| Inverse        | If not *p*, then not *q* | Converse       |
| Contrapositive | If not *q*, then not *p* | Conditional    |

---

#### Counterexample: Testing Logical Validity

A **counterexample** is a specific case used to test a logical statement's validity.

Consider:

> “If I am sitting on my floor, then I am home.”
> “I’m sitting on my couch, so I am not home.”

This uses **invalid logic** — just because you’re not sitting on the floor doesn’t prove you’re not home. By substituting part of the argument, you can disprove the structure, showing the statements are **not** logically equivalent.

---

#### Lesson Summary

* **Logical equivalence** means two statements always share the same truth value.
* A **conditional** is only logically equivalent to its **contrapositive**.
* The **converse** and **inverse** are logically equivalent to each other, but **not** to the original conditional.
* Use **counterexamples** to test whether logic holds true in **all** cases — a single valid counterexample disproves equivalence.
* Logical reasoning enables us to distinguish what’s structurally true — beyond surface phrasing.

### Section 7: Direct Proof

#### *Definition*

A **direct proof** is a logical method used to show that a **conditional statement** — one of the form `if p, then q` — is **true**. It proceeds by:

* Assuming the **hypothesis** (`p`) is true,
* Using **definitions**, **algebra**, and **known facts**,
* Step-by-step deriving the **conclusion** (`q`).

---

#### *Structure of a Conditional Statement*

* `p`: Hypothesis (the assumption or starting point)
* `q`: Conclusion (what must follow if `p` is true)

*Example:*
If `a` and `b` are odd integers, then `a + b` is even.

---

#### *Sample Direct Proof #1: Sum of Odd Integers Is Even*

**Statement:** If `a` and `b` are odd integers, then `a + b` is even.

**Proof:**

* Suppose `a` and `b` are odd integers.
* Then, by definition of odd numbers:
    `a = 2k + 1` and `b = 2l + 1` for some integers `k` and `l`.
* Add the expressions:
    `a + b = (2k + 1) + (2l + 1) = 2(k + l + 1)`
* Since `k + l + 1` is an integer, `a + b` is divisible by 2.
* Therefore, `a + b` is even.

✅ **Conclusion:** The sum of two odd integers is even.

---

#### *Sample Direct Proof #2: Product of Odd Integers Is Odd*

**Statement:** If `a` and `b` are odd integers, then `ab` is odd.

**Proof:**

* Suppose `a` and `b` are odd integers.
* Then:
    `a = 2x + 1` and `b = 2y + 1` for some integers `x` and `y`.
* Multiply the expressions:
    `ab = (2x + 1)(2y + 1)`
* Expand using distributive property:
    `ab = 4xy + 2x + 2y + 1`
* Factor out 2 from the first three terms:
    `ab = 2(2xy + x + y) + 1`
* Since `2xy + x + y` is an integer,
    `ab = 2(integer) + 1`, which is the definition of an odd number.

✅ **Conclusion:** The product of two odd integers is odd.

---

#### *Key Points to Remember*

* A **direct proof** is a sequence of logical steps starting from an assumption and using known facts to prove a conclusion.
* It is most often used with **conditional statements** (`if p, then q`).
* The goal is to connect the **hypothesis** to the **conclusion** using definitions, algebra, and properties of numbers.

### Section 8: Tautology

#### **Definition**

A **tautology** is a **logical statement that is always true**, regardless of the truth values of its component propositions. In symbolic logic, a tautology is confirmed when a **truth table** shows that the **final column contains only true (T)** values for all possible combinations of the variables.

---

#### **Understanding Through Example**

Take the statement:
**"I will either get paid or not get paid."**

Let:

* `p` = "I will get paid"
* `¬p` = "I will not get paid"
* Statement: `p ∨ ¬p` (Read: "`p` or not `p`")

This is always true because whether `p` is true or false, one part of the disjunction (`∨`) will always be true. Here's the truth table:

| `p` | `¬p` | `p ∨ ¬p` |
| --- | ---- | -------- |
| T   | F    | T        |
| F   | T    | T        |

✅ Since both rows in the final column are **T**, this is a **tautology**.

---

#### **Tautology via Implication**

Let’s test the statement:
**`p → (p ∨ q)`**

This reads: “If `p` is true, then `p or q` is true.”

| `p` | `q` | `p ∨ q` | `p → (p ∨ q)` |
| --- | --- | ------- | ------------- |
| T   | T   | T       | T             |
| T   | F   | T       | T             |
| F   | T   | T       | T             |
| F   | F   | F       | T             |

✅ All values in the final column are **T**, so the statement is a **tautology**.

---

#### **More Complex Example**

Test this statement:
**`(p → q) ∨ (q → p)`**

| `p` | `q` | `p → q` | `q → p` | Final: `(p → q) ∨ (q → p)` |
| --- | --- | ------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| T   | T   | T       | T       | T                          |
| T   | F   | F       | T       | T                          |
| F   | T   | T       | F       | T                          |
| F   | F   | T       | T       | T                          |

✅ Again, all values in the final column are **T**. Another **tautology**.

---

#### **Key Insight**

You do **not** need to know what the propositions **mean** to verify a tautology. You only need the **logical structure** and a completed **truth table**.

---

#### **Summary**

* A **tautology** is always true — in every possible logical case.
* To identify one:

  * Build a **truth table** for the logical statement.
  * Check the **final column**.
  * If **all values are true**, it’s a tautology.
* If **even one value is false**, then it **is not** a tautology.

### Understanding Sets

#### **Definition of a Set**

A **set** is a *collection of distinct objects*, called **elements** or **members**, enclosed in curly braces `{ }`.
*Example*:
Let `C = {pants, t-shirt, skirt, dress}`
\* `C` is the name of the set (capital letter).
 *The elements* are: pants, t-shirt, skirt, dress.

Sets can include **non-numerical objects** as well as numbers.

#### **Common Set Notation**

* `Z = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}` represents the **set of all integers**.
* The ellipsis `...` shows that the pattern continues indefinitely.

---

#### **Union of Sets**

*The **union** of two sets* includes **all elements from both sets**, without repetition.
*Symbol:* `∪` (read as "union")
*Example:*
Let `A = {green, blue, pink}`
Let `B = {orange, yellow, black}`
Then:
`A ∪ B = {green, blue, pink, orange, yellow, black}`
\* Includes everything from both A and B.\*

---

#### **Intersection of Sets**

*The **intersection** of two sets* includes **only the elements that are in both sets**.
*Symbol:* `∩` (read as "intersection")
*Example:*
Let `A = {4, 6, 9}`
Let `B = {7, 8, 9}`
Then:
`A ∩ B = {9}`
\* Only the number 9 appears in both A and B.\*

---

#### **Summary**

* A **set** is a group of distinct objects.
* Use **capital letters** to name sets.
* Enclose elements in **curly braces `{}`**.
* A **union (A ∪ B)** combines all unique elements from both sets.
* An **intersection (A ∩ B)** contains only elements common to both sets.
