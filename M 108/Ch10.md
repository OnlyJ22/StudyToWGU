### Section 1: The Identity Matrix and Inverse Matrices

#### What Is the Identity Matrix?

An **identity matrix** is a **square matrix** (same number of rows and columns) with:

* *1s along the main diagonal* (from top-left to bottom-right)
* *0s everywhere else*

> Think of the identity matrix as the number `1` in the matrix world.

##### Examples of Identity Matrices:

```
1×1 Identity:       [1]
2×2 Identity:   [1 0]
                 [0 1]
3×3 Identity:   [1 0 0]
                 [0 1 0]
                 [0 0 1]
```

#### Key Properties:

* **Notation**: `I`
* **Multiplicative Identity**:
  If `A` is any matrix, then:
  `A × I = A`
  `I × A = A`

---

#### What Is an Inverse Matrix?

The **inverse of a matrix** `A` is another matrix `A⁻¹` such that:

> `A × A⁻¹ = I`
> `A⁻¹ × A = I`

This is similar to how:

```
9 × (1/9) = 1
```

##### Notation:

* `A⁻¹` represents the inverse of matrix `A`

#### Important Notes:

* Not **every matrix has an inverse**
* Only **square matrices** may have inverses
* A matrix **without** an inverse is called **singular**

---

#### Why Are Inverse Matrices Useful?

* Inverse matrices allow us to **"divide"** by a matrix (since actual division is undefined)
* They’re used to solve matrix equations of the form:
  `AX = B` → `X = A⁻¹B`

---

#### How to Find an Inverse Matrix (2×2 or 3×3)

##### General Process (for square matrix `A`):

1. Write an **augmented matrix**: `[A | I]`
2. Use **row operations** to turn the left half into the identity matrix
3. The right half becomes `A⁻¹`

> Final result: `[I | A⁻¹]`

---

#### Example (Step-by-Step):

Suppose:

```
A = [1  0  3]
    [0  2  0]
    [-1 -2 -2]
```

Augment with identity matrix:

```
[A | I] =
[ 1  0  3 | 1  0  0 ]
[ 0  2  0 | 0  1  0 ]
[-1 -2 -2 | 0  0  1 ]
```

**Row Operations:**

* Add Row 2 to Row 3 → New Row 3: `[ -1+0  -2+2  -2+0 | 0+0  0+1  1+0 ]` → `[ -1  0  -2 | 0  1  1 ]`
* Multiply Row 3 by -3 and add to Row 1
* Divide Row 2 by 2

After these steps, the left side becomes the identity matrix, and the right side becomes the **inverse matrix** `A⁻¹`.

---

#### Lesson Summary

* The **identity matrix** acts like the number 1 in matrix multiplication.
* An **inverse matrix** `A⁻¹` satisfies `A × A⁻¹ = I`.
* Not all matrices have inverses.
* Inverse matrices allow us to "undo" matrix multiplication—similar to division.
* To **find the inverse**, augment the matrix with an identity matrix and use row operations to transform the left side into the identity. The right side becomes the inverse.

### Section 2: Rotations Using Matrices

#### What Is a Rotation?

A **rotation** is a transformation that turns a figure about a fixed point — often the origin — through a specified angle and direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). Think of how a **Ferris wheel rotates** around its center; this is the same geometric idea applied in the coordinate plane.

---

#### What Is a Matrix?

A **matrix** is a **rectangular array of numbers**, often used to represent geometric coordinates or transformations.

##### Example:

Suppose we have triangle **ABC** with vertices:

* A(1, 2)
* B(2, 1)
* C(3, 2)

This can be written as a **coordinate matrix**:

```
[ 1  2  3 ]   ← x-values  
[ 2  1  2 ]   ← y-values
```

---

#### Rotation Matrices (Counterclockwise)

Here are the **three rotation matrices** for standard angles:

* **90º counterclockwise**:

  ```
  [  0  -1 ]
  [  1   0 ]
  ```

* **180º counterclockwise**:

  ```
  [ -1   0 ]
  [  0  -1 ]
  ```

* **270º counterclockwise** (*or* 90º clockwise):

  ```
  [  0   1 ]
  [ -1   0 ]
  ```

---

#### How to Rotate Using a Matrix

To rotate a figure:

1. **Write the original coordinate matrix**
2. **Multiply** the **rotation matrix** by the coordinate matrix

##### Example 1: Rotate 90º Counterclockwise

Original triangle ABC:

```
[ 1  2  3 ]
[ 2  1  2 ]
```

Use the **90º counterclockwise** rotation matrix:

```
[  0  -1 ]
[  1   0 ]
```

**Matrix multiplication**:

```
[  0  -1 ]     [ 1  2  3 ]     =     [ -2  -1  -2 ]
[  1   0 ]  ×  [ 2  1  2 ]           [  1   2   3 ]
```

So the new triangle A'B'C' has coordinates:

* A′(–2, 1)
* B′(–1, 2)
* C′(–2, 3)

---

##### Example 2: Rotate 90º Clockwise (or 270º CCW)

Use the **270º counterclockwise** (or **90º clockwise**) rotation matrix:

```
[  0   1 ]
[ -1   0 ]
```

Multiply:

```
[  0   1 ]     [ 1  2  3 ]     =     [ 2  1  2 ]
[ -1   0 ]  ×  [ 2  1  2 ]           [ -1 -2 -3 ]
```

Resulting triangle A′B′C′ has coordinates:

* A′(2, –1)
* B′(1, –2)
* C′(2, –3)

---

#### Summary

To perform **rotations using matrices**:

* Represent points as a **coordinate matrix**
* Multiply by the appropriate **rotation matrix**
* Rotation matrices work for **standard angles** (90°, 180°, 270°)
* Remember:

  * **90º CCW** → `[ 0 -1 ; 1 0 ]`
  * **180º CCW** → `[ -1 0 ; 0 -1 ]`
  * **90º CW (270º CCW)** → `[ 0 1 ; -1 0 ]`

This method efficiently computes rotated coordinates using only matrix multiplication.

### Section 3: Matrix Transformations: Translations

#### What Is a Transformation?

A **transformation** is a way to manipulate a shape, line, or point on a coordinate plane. Common types include:

* **Translation** – moving a shape without rotating, flipping, or resizing it.
* **Rotation**
* **Reflection**
* **Dilation** (not covered here)

In this lesson, we focus on **translations** using matrices.

---

#### What Is a Translation?

A **translation** moves every point in a figure **the same distance in the same direction**.
For example, shifting a triangle 6 units right simply means adding 6 to every **x-value** of its points. If you move 2 units **down**, subtract 2 from every **y-value**.

---

#### Coordinate Matrices

Each point (x, y) can be written as a column in a **coordinate matrix**.
Example: Triangle ABC has the points:

* A(–4, 5)
* B(–1, 1)
* C(–4, –1)

This is represented as:

```
[ -4  -1  -4 ]
[  5   1  -1 ]
```

---

#### Translation Using Matrices

To perform a translation, **add a translation matrix** to the original coordinate matrix.

##### Example 1: Translate 6 Units Right

Translation vector:
`x → x + 6`, `y → y + 0`
Translation matrix:

```
[  6   6   6 ]
[  0   0   0 ]
```

Add to coordinate matrix:

```
[ -4  -1  -4 ]     [  6   6   6 ]     =     [  2   5   2 ]
[  5   1  -1 ]  +  [  0   0   0 ]           [  5   1  -1 ]
```

New coordinates of A′B′C′:

* A′(2, 5)
* B′(5, 1)
* C′(2, –1)

---

##### Example 2: Translate 6 Units Right and 2 Units Down

Translation vector:
`x → x + 6`, `y → y – 2`

Translation matrix:

```
[  6   6   6 ]
[ -2  -2  -2 ]
```

Add to original:

```
[ -4  -1  -4 ]     [  6   6   6 ]     =     [  2   5   2 ]
[  5   1  -1 ]  +  [ -2  -2  -2 ]           [  3  -1  -3 ]
```

New coordinates:

* A′(2, 3)
* B′(5, –1)
* C′(2, –3)

---

#### Summary

* **Matrix translation** involves adding a translation matrix to a coordinate matrix.
* A **translation matrix** has the same number of columns as points and adjusts **x and y values** by a fixed amount.
* Translation is **directional but not rotational** — the shape's size and orientation remain unchanged.

Once you build and add the matrices correctly, you've successfully completed a transformation via matrix translation.
